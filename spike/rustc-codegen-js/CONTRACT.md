# Spike interface contract

Every component (backend, mini_core, tests, shim, scripts, demo) is built by a different
agent in parallel. This file is the single source of truth for the interfaces between them.
Do not deviate from it; if something proves impossible, note it in your report instead of
silently changing the contract.

## Toolchain

`nightly-2026-07-27` pinned by ./rust-toolchain.toml (components rust-src, rustc-dev,
llvm-tools). Being installed at spike start; may still be downloading — poll
`rustup run nightly-2026-07-27 rustc --version` before relying on it.

## Compilation command (produced .js file)

```
rustc +nightly-2026-07-27 \
  -Zcodegen-backend=<abs path to target/release/librustc_codegen_js.dylib> \
  --edition 2021 --crate-type lib --emit=obj \
  -Ccodegen-units=1 -Cpanic=abort -Coverflow-checks=off -Cdebuginfo=0 \
  -o <out>.js <test>.rs
```

The "object file" the backend writes IS the JavaScript text. If rustc mangles the output
path, scripts/compile.sh normalizes it afterward.

## Test crate shape (no_core, single crate, no linking)

Each test in examples/tests/NN_name.rs starts with EXACTLY this header:

```rust
#![feature(no_core, lang_items, intrinsics, rustc_attrs, decl_macro)]
#![feature(auto_traits, freeze_impls, unboxed_closures)]
#![allow(internal_features, dead_code, unused_variables)]
#![no_core]
#![no_main]

#[path = "../mini_core.rs"]
mod mini_core;
use mini_core::*;

#[no_mangle]
fn rust_entry() {
    // test body
}
```

`examples/mini_core.rs` contains ITEMS ONLY (no crate-level `#![...]` attributes — those
live in each test's header above; if mini_core needs more feature gates, add them to the
header spec here and use the same header everywhere).

## Print/abort shim (the ONLY foreign functions)

mini_core declares exactly these foreign items plus safe wrappers:

```rust
extern "C" {
    fn js_log_i32(x: i32);
    fn js_log_i64(x: i64);
    fn js_log_f64(x: f64);
    fn js_log_bool(x: bool);
    fn js_log_str(ptr: &str);      // backend passes the JS string value directly
    fn js_abort(msg: &str) -> !;
}
pub fn print_i32(x: i32) { unsafe { js_log_i32(x) } }
pub fn print_i64(x: i64) { unsafe { js_log_i64(x) } }
pub fn print_f64(x: f64) { unsafe { js_log_f64(x) } }
pub fn print_bool(x: bool) { unsafe { js_log_bool(x) } }
pub fn print_str(s: &str) { unsafe { js_log_str(s) } }
```

Backend lowers any call to a foreign item (no MIR) to `__rt.<symbol_name>(args...)`.

runtime/shim.js defines (plain script, NOT an ES module):

```js
globalThis.__rt = {
  js_log_i32: (x) => console.log(x),
  js_log_i64: (x) => console.log(x.toString()),
  js_log_f64: (x) => console.log(x),
  js_log_bool: (x) => console.log(x),
  js_log_str: (s) => console.log(s),
  js_abort: (msg) => { throw new Error("rust abort: " + msg); },
};
```

Number printing: js_log_f64 must print `3` for 3.0 (JS default). Tests' .expected files
must match node's default console.log formatting (booleans print as `true`/`false`).

## Emitted JS shape (backend output)

- Plain script (no ES modules, no imports). One top-level
  `function <name>(arg0, arg1, ...) { ... }` per monomorphized item.
- `#[no_mangle]` / `#[export_name]` items use the exact symbol name; everything else uses
  a sanitized unique name (def-path with `::` -> `__`, `$`-prefixed hash suffix allowed).
  Spike relaxation: falling back to the v0-mangled symbol name for internal items is
  ACCEPTABLE (nothing external depends on them); sanitized names are preferred for
  debuggability but not required for the milestone.
- Runner executes `cat runtime/shim.js <out>.js scripts/entry.js | node -`, where
  scripts/entry.js is exactly `rust_entry();`. So `rust_entry` must be a top-level
  function declaration in the emitted output.

## Value representation (backend AND tests must agree)

- i8..i32/u8..u32, isize/usize: JS numbers. i32 arithmetic masked with `|0`, u32 with
  `>>>0`, i8/i16 sign-extended via `<<24>>24` / `<<16>>16` as needed, `Math.imul` for
  32-bit multiply. usize/isize treated as safe integers (no masking).
- Wide integers (stage 1): i64/u64/i128/u128 are JS **BigInt**, not numbers. Masking is
  `BigInt.asIntN`/`BigInt.asUintN`; literals print bare via `.toString()` (never with a
  trailing `n`), which is what `js_log_i64` does. Mixed-width operations coerce at the
  boundary: a shift amount arriving as a Number must become a BigInt, and a
  BigInt<->Number cast must go through `Number()`/`BigInt()` plus the target's mask.
  Tests 01-08 stay Number-only; 12_bigint.rs is the BigInt suite.
  Related: stage 1 compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so `usize`/`isize` are exactly
  32 bits and mask with `>>>0`/`|0`. 13_usize.rs encodes that (its expectations were
  validated natively with `usize` transplanted to `u32`).
- f32/f64: JS numbers (f32 without fround in the spike). bool: JS booleans. char: number.
- `&str`: JS string. String indexing/bytes: NOT in scope for tests.
- Structs: `{ field_name: v, ... }` (real field names). Tuples & arrays: JS arrays.
  ZSTs/unit: `undefined`.
- Enums: three shapes, chosen by the enum's own declaration -- see "Enums (stage 3)" below,
  which is the specification. In short: a fieldless `#[repr(int)]` enum is the plain number its
  discriminant is; any other fieldless enum is the bare **string** naming the variant; an enum with
  a payload-carrying variant is `{ TAG: "<VariantName>", _0: ..., _1: ... }`, with named-field
  variants using their field names alongside `TAG`.
- References: `&`/`&mut` to an aggregate is just the value (aliasing by JS object identity).
  Everything else is a `{ buf, off }` **slot**, and an address-taken local of such a type is
  boxed — see "Pointers (stage 1.5)" below, which supersedes this line. Cells (`{ v: value }`)
  and accessors (`{ get, set }`) were the stage 0 and stage 1 spellings and no longer exist.
- Copy of an aggregate = shallow clone; Move = alias.
- `Box<T>` is **the pointer it owns**, and nothing else: a slot for a sized `T`, a fat slice for
  `Box<[T]>`, a fat dyn for `Box<dyn Trait>`. See "Allocation".
- `String` has no representation of its own: it is a `Vec<u8>`, a heap block of one byte elements,
  and becomes a JavaScript string only where something derefs it to a `&str`.

## Test list (examples/tests/) and what each may use

01_arith.rs      ints (wrapping via ops), f64, bool, comparisons, print shims
02_control.rs    if/else, while, loop/break/continue, nested match on ints
03_structs.rs    structs, tuples, field mutation, &/&mut to locals and fields
04_enums.rs      multi-variant enum with payloads (incl. one named-field variant), match
05_recursion.rs  direct recursion (factorial/fib) + mutual recursion (is_even/is_odd)
06_generics.rs   generic fn + generic struct, >=2 instantiations
07_traits.rs     trait w/ default + overridden method, static dispatch, generic bound
08_closures.rs   Fn/FnMut closures (by-ref and by-value capture), closure passed to
                 a generic fn taking `impl Fn(i32) -> i32`-style bound (via mini_core Fn traits)

Added with the stage-1 language core, and green since:

09_drop.rs       Drop impls, drop order, nested droppable fields, early-return drops
10_dyn.rs        &dyn / &mut dyn Trait, vtables, default and overridden methods
11_statics.rs    scalar/array/struct/&str statics, `static mut` through unsafe
12_bigint.rs     i64/u64 arithmetic, div/rem truncation, shifts, casts, i64 switch
13_usize.rs      usize/isize as EXACTLY 32 bits (wrapping, indexing, casts)
14_slices.rs     &[T]/&mut [T] coercion, indexing, slice patterns, ptr_metadata length
15_intrinsics.rs the intrinsics table, at mini_core scale
16_byte_enum_str.rs  a slice of one-byte `#[repr(u8)]` enum values cast to `*const str`,
                 through both `as` and `transmute`: the mini_core-scale pin for the cast
                 that `[AsciiChar]::as_str` is in real `core`

Each NN_name.rs has NN_name.expected = exact expected stdout (newline-terminated).
Tests must be deterministic, print-based, and stay within mini_core's vocabulary.
For 01-08 that vocabulary excludes Drop impls, dyn, trait objects and slices; 09-14
are exactly the tests that add them. No std, no core, no alloc, no Vec, no string
formatting anywhere -- print numbers and literal strs only.

## Scripts

- scripts/build.sh    — cargo build --release (the backend dylib) from the spike root
- scripts/compile.sh  — $1=src $2=out.js; runs the rustc command above
- scripts/entry.js    — exactly `rust_entry();`
- scripts/test.sh     — build backend, then for each examples/tests/*.rs: compile,
                        run `cat runtime/shim.js out.js scripts/entry.js | node -`,
                        diff against .expected; print PASS/FAIL summary; nonzero exit on
                        any failure. Artifacts go to build/ (gitignored). Also runs the
                        examples/core-tests/ suite when a sysroot exists.
- scripts/build_sysroot.sh — patch and build the real `core`, `compiler_builtins` and `alloc`
                        with this backend into build/sysroot; run once before the core suite
- scripts/compile_core.sh — $1=src $2=out.js against that sysroot (cdylib, so the link
                        step runs)
- scripts/emit-test.sh — the emitted-JavaScript goldens (see "Emit goldens" below);
                        UPDATE_EXPECT=1 rebaselines
- scripts/module-test.sh — compiles every emit fixture as a script and as an ES module and holds
                        that the two agree item for item (see "Modules")
- scripts/run-esm.sh  — runs a `js-modules=esm` program under node: the ES module form of the
                        shim beside it, `rust_entry` imported by name
- scripts/make-esm-shim.mjs — derives that ES module form from runtime/shim.js
- scripts/check-sourcemap.js — decodes and checks a `.map` the backend wrote (see
                        "Source maps"); `node scripts/check-sourcemap.js build/03_structs.js`
- scripts/dom-test.sh — the `view!` suite: expands each examples/dom-tests fixture, compiles it as
                        an ES module, runs it against the contract's recording stub and diffs both
                        the JavaScript and the trace (see "Templates"); UPDATE_EXPECT=1 rebaselines
- scripts/dom-trace.mjs — runs one compiled client module against contract/harness/trace.mjs and
                        prints the trace as JSON Lines

## Stage 1 + 2 deltas

Everything above describes the stage-0 spike and still holds except where this section says
otherwise. Each entry is a decision that was made while building stage 1 or stage 2 and that
another component has to agree with.

### Compilation

The command in "Compilation command" gains `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown` and
`--remap-path-prefix "$root/="` (the second so that a `#[track_caller]` location is repository
relative rather than a path to somebody's checkout — see "Hoisted constants"). Nothing is ever
handed to LLVM, so the only thing the target decides is the data layout the backend reads off
`tcx` — and a 32-bit pointer width is what makes `usize`/`isize` exactly `u32`/`i32`, so layouts,
niches, `size_of` and the constants rustc folds all agree with the JS side by construction. No
wasm toolchain component is needed: a `#![no_core]` crate compiled with `--emit=obj` never links.

Tests against the real `core` use a second command (`scripts/compile_core.sh`):
`--sysroot build/sysroot --crate-type cdylib`, the sysroot being what `scripts/build_sysroot.sh`
builds. `cdylib` is the point — it makes rustc run `CodegenBackend::link`, which is where
whole-program dead code elimination and zombie reporting happen.

Backend options ride in on `-Cllvm-args`, space separated (`scripts/compile.sh` forwards
`$JS_EXTRA_ARGS`):

```text
js-names=readable|mangled    how identifiers are spelled; readable is the default
js-root=NAME                 an extra dead-code-elimination root, repeatable
js-structure=regions|trampoline   how control flow is rebuilt
js-queue=on|off              the expression queue
js-switch=dtree|flat         how `SwitchInt` is spelled
js-comments=on|off           the `// <def path>` header comment on each item (default on)
js-line-comments             `// file.rs:LINE` comments before each run of statements
js-source-map=on|off         write a `.map` beside the program (default off; see "Source maps")
js-emit-skip=PREFIX          hide items under a def path prefix (see "Emit goldens")
js-scoped-lets               declare locals at their region LCA
js-minify=on|locals|off      short names and compact printing (default off; see "Minify mode")
js-hoist-consts=on|off       share repeated constants (default on; see "Hoisted constants")
js-modules=esm|script        ES module or plain script (default script; see "Modules")
js-shim-module=SPEC          where `__rt` is imported from (default `./shim.js`)
js-dom-module=SPEC           where the DOM runtime is imported from (default `topcoat-dom`)
```

`$JS_EXTRA_ARGS` is forwarded by **all three** compile paths: `scripts/compile.sh`,
`scripts/compile_core.sh` and `scripts/build_sysroot.sh` (which turns each space separated option
into its own `-Cllvm-args=`, since rustflags are split on whitespace).

**An option is emit-affecting when it can change the text of an item two crates might both
codegen.** That is the whole of the rule, and everything below follows from it: an option that
only decides what the *link step* synthesizes around the items, or that only reaches the leaf
crate's own output, is not emit-affecting however visible its effect on the finished file. The
module options are the worked example -- see "Modules".

**Every crate in one program must be compiled with the same emit-affecting flags.** The same
generic instantiation is codegenned in several crates, and the link step compares the two
spellings: if `core` was built with one set of flags and the crate linking it with another, the
identical function comes out as two different definitions and the link fails with
`two different definitions of ...`. Rebuild the sysroot after any change that alters emitted code
(readable local names did exactly this):

```sh
JS_EXTRA_ARGS='js-names=mangled' ./scripts/build_sysroot.sh   # then the same for the crate
```

Emit-affecting, so the sysroot has to be rebuilt to match: `js-names`, `js-structure`,
`js-queue`, `js-switch`, `js-scoped-lets`, `js-minify`, `js-hoist-consts` and
**`js-line-comments`** — the last one is
the surprise, because only the *leading* header comment run is stripped before two definitions are
compared (`LinkItem::code`), and its comments are interleaved through the body.

`scripts/build_sysroot.sh` records the options it built with in `build/sysroot/.js-args`, and
`scripts/test.sh` rebuilds the sysroot when they disagree with its own `$JS_EXTRA_ARGS`, so the
suite is green in every mode from one command. The diagnostic says so too: a
`two different definitions of ...` error now carries the note that names the cause.

Not emit-affecting, so they can be passed to one crate alone: `js-comments` (the header comment
run, which is exactly what `LinkItem::code` strips), `js-emit-skip` (acted on by the test script,
never by the backend), the three **module options** (everything they add is synthesized at link
time; see "Modules") and **`js-source-map`** (its markers print nothing; the JavaScript is
required to come out byte for byte identical). A map can therefore be asked for without rebuilding
the sysroot — a `core` built without one simply contributes items with no mappings, which then
read as generated glue and are stepped over.

### Value representation

- `isize`/`usize` are exactly 32 bits and **are masked**, superseding the "no masking" line above:
  `>>>0` for `usize`, `|0` for `isize`.
- `&[T]` / `&mut [T]` is `{ buf, off, len }`: the backing JS array, a start offset into it, and a
  length. A subslice **shares `buf`** and only moves `off`/`len`, so a write through the subslice
  is visible in the original — which is the aliasing Rust guarantees, not an accident.
- `&dyn Trait` is `{ ptr, meta }`: the data value and the vtable.
- A vtable is a module level JS **array** in `tcx.vtable_entries` order:
  `[drop_glue_or_null, size, align, method, method, ...]`. rustc's own slot numbering is kept, so
  a virtual call is a single index — `InstanceKind::Virtual(_, idx)` already counts the three
  header slots. Vacant entries are `null`; a supertrait vtable is a nested array.
- `&*p` where `*p` is unsized is the **identity**: the fat pointer already carries everything a
  place of that type is (`buf`/`off`/`len`, or `ptr`/`meta`), so there is nothing to re-wrap.

### Runtime shim additions

`runtime/shim.js` defines these beyond the print/abort members above:

```js
__rt.f2i(x, min, max)        // saturating float -> integer cast (NaN -> 0)
__rt.f2i_big(x, bits, signed)// the same for the BigInt widths
__rt.overwrite(target, value)// replace every own key of `target` with `value`'s
```

`overwrite` is what makes a whole-enum write correct: assigning a new variant into an existing
object has to *remove* the old variant's payload keys, not leave them next to the new ones.

### Calls to foreign items

A foreign declaration is only a shim call if its ABI says so. `extern "C"` (and friends) lowers to
`__rt.<symbol>(args...)`, as above. A declaration with the **Rust** ABI is not a foreign function
at all — it is a Rust symbol some other crate in the program defines, and the declaration exists
only because the definition cannot be named directly. Those lower to an ordinary direct call.
`core`'s `panic_impl` (the `#[panic_handler]`) is the case that matters; the allocator shims have
the same shape.

### `#[panic_handler]` crates must not format

A `#![no_std]` crate's panic handler may read `PanicInfo::location()` — the `Location` arrives
through the `#[track_caller]` chain and its accessors are plain field reads. It must **not** touch
`PanicInfo::message()`: formatting a `fmt::Arguments` walks a byte-packed template through raw
pointer arithmetic, which has no meaning where a value is a JavaScript object rather than bytes at
an address. `patches/0001-panic-without-formatting.patch` applies the same rule inside `core`
itself, replacing the formatted runtime panic messages with their constant equivalents; without it
`panic_display` builds a `&dyn Display` whose vtable keeps every `Display` impl in the program
alive.

The rule is about the *handler*, not about formatting: `write!` into a `fmt::Write` sink runs, and
`examples/core-tests/11_fmt.rs` is the golden that pins it.

### Not supported (each is a zombie, reported only if reachable)

Mutating a `&mut str` · unsizing a struct with more than one field · `simd_*` intrinsics ·
`f16`/`f128` · `global_asm!`.

Reinterpreting a buffer at another element size — `align_to`, and the chunked reads built on it —
is **not** a zombie but a run time refusal (`__rt.scale`/`__rt.unscale`/`__rt.chunk_slice`). It has
to be: the unreachable-at-run-time fast path of `str::count::do_count_chars` is on the static call
graph of every `Display for str`, so a zombie there would reject `write!` itself.

### Names

`backend/src/naming.rs` invents every item name and `backend/src/names.rs` every local name;
nothing else in the backend builds an identifier.

- An item is a sanitized def path with `::` spelled `$`, plus an unconditional `$h` and 16 hex
  digits of a hash of its v0 symbol. The hash is not collision *repair* — it is what makes a name
  depend on nothing but the item itself, so two crates spell a shared item identically.
  `#[no_mangle]`/`#[export_name]` items keep their exact name.
- A local is named after the body's `var_debug_info` where it says something (`sum`, `acc`, `i`)
  and `_0`, `_1`, ... where it does not. `_0` is always the return place. Parameters are named the
  same way, in the signature and at every use.
- The `$` prefix is the backend's own namespace — `$t0` (hoisted temporaries), `$s0` (structurizer
  selectors and bound scrutinees), `$loc` (the `#[track_caller]` location), `$v` (accessor setter
  parameter). A Rust identifier cannot contain a `$`, so nothing a user writes can collide.
- A splatted `"rust-call"` tuple parameter takes `<name>$e0`, `<name>$e1`, ...; two locals that
  want the same readable name are distinguished with `$1`, `$2`, numbered per function.
- Invariants the link step depends on: an item name never starts with `$`, never matches `^_[0-9]`
  and is never `bb`; a local name obeys the same three rules and additionally never shadows `__rt`
  or a JS builtin the emitted code reads.
- `-Cllvm-args=js-names=mangled` restores raw v0 symbols and numbered locals, which is how a
  naming bug is told apart from a lowering bug. **It cannot carry a program whose sysroot has both
  `core` and `alloc`**: rustc appends the *instantiating crate* to the symbol of a cross-crate
  generic instance, so `core` and `alloc` spell one shared instantiation two ways, and the items
  that call it then differ. Readable names do not have the problem — their hash is taken over the
  instance's crate-independent stable hash, which is what [`Namer::hash_key`] exists for — so
  `js-names=mangled` is now a mini_core and single-dependency tool.
- `-Cllvm-args=js-minify=on` replaces both halves with generated names — `$a` for an item, `a` for
  a local — in two disjoint namespaces. See "Minify mode".

### Emitted JS shape

- Each item may be preceded by a `// <def path>` header comment (`js-comments`, on by default).
  The comment belongs to the declaration that follows it: the blank line goes **before** the
  comment, never between it and its declaration.
- `js-line-comments` adds `// <file>:<line>` before each run of statements lowered from the same
  Rust line — the cheap, readable-in-a-golden-file cousin of a source map. The path is spelled as
  rustc would spell it in a diagnostic, so `--remap-path-prefix` applies.

### Source maps (`js-source-map=on`)

A **source map v3** is written beside the finished program, so a browser steps through the Rust
rather than through the JavaScript.

- Artifacts: `<out>.js.map` next to `<out>.js`, and `//# sourceMappingURL=<basename>.js.map` as
  the **last line** of the JavaScript. Both output paths produce it: the single crate
  `--emit=obj` path (`link.rs::prune_objects`, what `scripts/compile.sh` uses) and the real link
  path (`link.rs::link`, what `scripts/compile_core.sh` uses). Object files inside an rlib never
  get one — nothing steps through an intermediate — so the map comment can never collide with the
  `//# rcgjs:` item table footer, which only object files carry.
- **The JavaScript does not change.** With the option on, the output is byte for byte what it was
  with the option off, plus the trailing `sourceMappingURL` line. The locations ride in the AST as
  `Stmt::Loc` markers, which print nothing; the peepholes that pattern match on statements
  (`else if` chains, `while` recovery, destination passing, the trailing `return`) all look
  through them on purpose.
- Granularity is one mapping per **run of statements from one Rust position** — the same seam and
  the same de-duplication as `js-line-comments`.
- `sources` are file names as rustc spells them in a diagnostic (`--remap-path-prefix` applies).
  `sourcesContent` carries the text of every source this compilation still holds, which makes
  stepping work over `file://` with no server; a file that came from a dependency's rlib is `null`
  and the browser resolves it against the map's URL.
- `names` maps an emitted name to the Rust one: a function's def path, and every local whose
  spelling had to change (`self$1`). A fresh mapping is opened immediately after each such
  identifier, because a debugger reads the name off whatever mapping covers it.
- Every generated line is mapped. A line with nothing of its own repeats the mapping in effect —
  Firefox stops a mapping at the end of its line — and a line at the start of an item, or before
  any location at all, maps to the synthetic source `<rustc_codegen_js generated>`, which is the
  only entry in `ignoreList`. That is the blackboxing rule: the prologue, the dispatch scaffolding
  and the missing-item stubs are code no Rust programmer wrote, and a debugger told so steps over
  them.
- `scripts/check-sourcemap.js <out.js> [source-substring]` checks a map without a browser: JSON
  shape, every VLQ segment, every index in range, every generated position inside the file, every
  original position inside its source, every line mapped, and `ignoreList` naming only glue.
  `demo/index.html`'s header comment has the manual DevTools recipe.
- Byte budgets (`NN.maxbytes`) are **not enforced** by `scripts/test.sh` when `$JS_EXTRA_ARGS`
  asks for `js-source-map`, `js-line-comments` or `js-minify`: the budgets are baselined against
  the default mode, and moving them to fit another mode would stop them catching what they exist
  for. Sizes are still reported.

### Minify mode (`js-minify=on`)

`-Cllvm-args=js-minify=on` shortens names and drops the whitespace. Off by default; **with it off
the emitted JavaScript is byte for byte what it was before minification existed**, which
`scripts/test.sh` and `scripts/emit-test.sh` between them pin on 48 runtime fixtures and 20 JS
goldens.

Three things happen, in two places:

- **Local names** (`backend/src/minify.rs`, at codegen time, per item): a function's parameters,
  `let`s, `$`-temporaries and labels become `a`, `b`, `c`, ... Parameters take the alphabet
  positionally first, then the remaining names are taken in order of falling occurrence count,
  each given the shortest name still free — js_of_ocaml's strategy, measured there within 0.06% of
  a mixed-integer-programming optimum, with no interference graph. Ties break on the name, which
  makes the output a function of the input alone. The alphabet is jsoo's: 54 characters may start
  an identifier and 64 may continue one, encoded little-endian.
- **Item names** (`backend/src/minify.rs`, at link time, once): every reachable item that is not
  exported becomes `$a`, `$b`, `$c`, ... by the same frequency rule. This *has* to be
  whole-program — an item is codegenned by whichever crate instantiated it and called from any
  other — and by then an item is text, so the pass is a scan rather than a parse. It is sound
  because it substitutes only exact matches of names in the link step's own item table, and skips
  string literals, `//` comments and identifiers after a `.` (a property, a different namespace).
  The text is not arbitrary JavaScript but this backend's printer output, which has no regular
  expression literals, no template literals, no single quoted strings and no block comments.
- **Compact printing** (`jsast::Style::Compact`): no indentation, no newlines inside a
  declaration, no spaces that only separate tokens, no `;` before a `}`, no braces around a
  single-statement `if`/`while` body that cannot itself be an `if` (which is what keeps the
  dangling-else problem out), and `!0`, `!1`, `void 0` for `true`, `false`, `undefined`. Where two
  tokens would fuse — `a - -b`, `a + +b`, an accidental `//`, the `<!` and `-->` of an HTML
  comment — a space goes back in; that table is jsoo's `need_space` and is checked on the
  characters that actually met, not on the AST.

The two namespaces are disjoint **by construction**: a generated item name always starts with `$`
and a generated local name never does. That is what lets the two passes run in different places
without either having to know what the other did. Beyond that, a local never takes a name the
function it is in already mentions (so it cannot shadow an item, `__rt` or a JS builtin), never a
reserved word, and never one of the globals in `minify.rs::GLOBALS`.

What keeps its name: **exported items** (`#[no_mangle]`, `#[export_name]`) at both passes —
`counter_clicked` is called from `demo/index.html` and `rust_entry` from `scripts/entry.js`, and
renaming those would be renaming the program's interface. An export short enough for the allocator
to reach (three characters or fewer) is warned about at link time, because it is the one name the
local renamer cannot see; this is the same hazard `names.rs` documents for readable local names.

- `js-minify` is **emit-affecting**, so the sysroot's `core` has to be built with it too — see
  "Compilation". `scripts/test.sh` now keeps the two in step by itself.
- `js-minify` turns `js-comments` **off** (a header comment is the larger half of a small item) and
  **refuses `js-source-map`**, with a warning: the map's `names` table would name variables the
  minified program no longer has. Renaming through the map is the designed fix and is not built.
- `js-minify=locals` is the bisecting step: compact printing and short local names, item names left
  alone. A minified program is then still greppable for a def path, and it is how the two halves of
  the win were measured apart.
- Item `refs` sets are left exactly as codegen computed them. They are over-approximations
  intersected with the item table, and local renaming cannot change which *item* names an item
  mentions; recomputing would only swap one set of ignored entries for another.

`scripts/measure-size.sh` produces the table below — raw and gzipped bytes, because a program is
served compressed and a long name repeated a hundred times costs a hundred back-references rather
than a hundred names. Five mini_core fixtures, three core fixtures and the demo:

The mini_core rows are smaller than they were before `--remap-path-prefix` reached
`scripts/compile.sh` (`01_arith` was 9094/3769) and the gzip columns are slightly larger than they
were before constant hoisting; "Hoisted constants" has the per-flag breakdown.

The `locals` column is why the item pass exists. Compact printing plus short locals is a 15-25%
gzip cut on its own; shortening the item names on top of it is worth another 15-35 points, because
a readable item name is 20 to 60 characters and 30-60% of the raw bytes of a program. Post-gzip it
still dominates: the compressor turns the repeats into back-references but pays for each name once,
and there are hundreds of them.

### Emit goldens (examples/emit/)

`scripts/emit-test.sh` compiles each fixture in `examples/emit/` with pinned flags and checks two
expectations: `NN.expected` (stdout under node) and `NN.js.expected` (the emitted JavaScript,
byte for byte). Both, always — a golden JS file on its own would let a beautifully formatted
miscompilation through. `UPDATE_EXPECT=1 scripts/emit-test.sh` rebaselines.

`js-emit-skip=PREFIX` is a **display** rule, applied by the script to the emitted text and not by
the backend: the file that runs is the unfiltered one, because an item the backend actually left
out would be a `ReferenceError` rather than a tidier golden. It exists so that the `mini_core::`
prelude every fixture drags in does not rebaseline all fourteen fixtures whenever mini_core
changes.

A fixture may carry two more companion files. `NN.skip` replaces the def path prefixes hidden from
the golden, and `NN.core` marks a fixture compiled against the real `core` and `alloc` in
`build/sysroot` rather than against mini_core. `17_alloc_shim` is the pair's reason for existing:
the allocator shim is the one thing in a program no crate has a body for, so pinning it needs a
program that actually allocates, and its skip list hides everything the standard library brought
along. `scripts/module-test.sh` passes over a `NN.core` fixture — the invariant it holds is a
property of codegen rather than of what a crate depends on.

`14_pointers` is the stage 1.5 addition: it pins the *shape* of the pointer model — a slot
dereferenced on both sides of an assignment, an offset folded into the index it produces
(`p.buf[p.off + n]`), a primitive local boxed because its address is taken, and the loop every
monomorphized `slice::Iter` becomes.

## Demo (demo/)

counter.rs: same no_core header + mini_core; a `Counter` struct with
`fn increment(&mut self)` and a `#[no_mangle] fn counter_clicked(n: i32) -> i32`
pure handler (state lives in JS). index.html: loads shim.js and counter.js (script tags),
a button and a span; clicking calls `counter_clicked(current)` and renders the result.
No server needed — file:// friendly.

## Pointers (stage 1.5)

A pointer is a **slot**: `{ buf, off }`, a container plus a key, where `buf` is a JS array or
object and `off` is a number index or a string property key. `off` counts **units of the pointee
type**, never bytes. Reading through a pointer is `p.buf[p.off]`, which is an assignable JS place,
so a write through a pointer is an ordinary assignment and every alias sees it. Every operation
that produces a pointer either names a real slot or degrades to a provenance free number, and
nothing in between.

`backend/src/ptr.rs` is the one place that builds and consumes these records; every other module
goes through it. It is also where the model is being landed: an operation that does not implement
the specification below says so in its doc comment, and the shim helper behind it throws instead of
answering.

### Forms

| form | shape | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| slot | `{ buf, off }` | a pointer to one place, dereferenceable |
| scaled slot | `{ buf, off, sc }` | a byte offset view of a buffer of `sc`-byte elements, from an `as *const u8` cast; **not** dereferenceable |
| window slot | `{ buf, off, w }` | a pointer to `w` consecutive elements, from an `as *const [E; N]` cast |
| fat slice | `{ buf, off, len }` | `&[T]`, `*const [T]`, unchanged from stage 1 |
| fat dyn | `{ ptr, meta }` | `&dyn Trait`, unchanged from stage 1 |
| fat tail | `{ ptr, meta }` | a pointer to a **struct with an unsized tail**; see below |
| address | a JS number | `null()`, `NonNull::dangling()`, `without_provenance`, an integer transmuted to a pointer, and a pointer in a constant with no provenance behind it; never dereferenceable |
| object | the pointee's own JS value | a reference to an aggregate, which keeps its identity |
| string | a JS string | `&str` |

A slot record is **immutable**: an offset produces a new record rather than moving `off`, which is
what keeps `Operand::Copy` of a pointer an alias rather than a clone.

### References and raw pointers

The two differ for aggregate pointees only.

- `&T` and `&mut T` of an aggregate are the aggregate's own JS object. This is what keeps the
  emitted code readable, and it is not negotiable.
- `*const T` and `*mut T` of an aggregate are a slot: the slot naming the place the reference was
  read out of (`{ buf: points, off: i }` for `&raw const points[i]`), which is what keeps a pointer
  to one element of an array able to reach the next. A raw pointer taken from a bare object goes
  through `__rt.box`, which keeps one slot per object in a `WeakMap`, so two raw pointers taken
  from one object are the same record and `ptr::eq` on them is true. The reverse, a reference from
  a raw pointer, is `p.buf[p.off]`.
- A pointee that is a JS primitive (a number, a `bool`, a `char`, a function pointer) has no object
  to point at, so **every** pointer to it is a slot: a local whose address is taken is boxed
  (`let x = [init]`, used as `x[0]`, with a parameter re-bound in the function prelude), and so is
  a static of such a type.

Two rules about boxing that are easy to get wrong, and both are miscompilations when they are:

- **A borrow the backend never lowers is not a borrow.** A `view-abi` marker's `&root` argument is
  read at codegen time and the assignment that computed it is dropped ("Templates" below), so that
  borrow is not in the emitted program and its local needs no box. `uses.rs` counts twice for this:
  once to find the dropped assignments, then again discounting the borrows they take. Only the
  boxing flag is discounted; every count stays as MIR wrote it, so a local such a statement mentions
  is still neither inlined nor treated as immutable.
- **A boxed return place is read through its box.** The return place is a local like any other and
  can be boxed, so `return` reads `_0[0]`, and destination passing (folding the last assignment to
  `_0` into the `return`) is off for one: the box may still be named by a slot the body handed out,
  so the store into it has to stay.

### Dereference

| pointer form | `*p` reads | `*p = v` writes |
|---|---|---|
| slot | `p.buf[p.off]` | assignment to `p.buf[p.off]` |
| object | the object itself | `__rt.overwrite(p, v)`, so every alias sees it |
| fat slice, fat dyn | the record; the projections that follow read `buf`/`off`/`len` or `ptr` | as for the pointee it names |
| fat tail | the record at `p.ptr`; `p.meta` is kept for the projection that reads the tail | as for the record it names |
| zero sized pointee | `undefined` | nothing is stored, but the value is still evaluated |
| `&str` | the string | a zombie: `&mut str` has no mutable JS form |
| scaled slot, address | a run time error | a run time error |

`&*p` where `*p` is unsized stays the identity: the fat pointer already carries everything a place
of that type is.

### A struct with an unsized tail

A struct whose **last field is unsized** is unsized itself, and it is neither a slice nor a trait
object: it is a record with a run of elements at the end of it. A pointer to one is fat, and it
carries the record rather than the tail:

```js
{ ptr: <the record>, meta: <the tail's length> }
```

The same two keys a `&dyn Trait` uses, for the same reason: what the pointer names is one value
and the metadata beside it is what says how much of it there is. `ptr` is always the **reference**
form of the record, even when the pointer being coerced is a raw one, because everything past the
coercion projects fields out of a record.

`core`'s `array::IntoIter` is why this exists, and it is what `for x in [a, b, c]` compiles to. It
holds a `PolymorphicIter<[MaybeUninit<T>; N]>` -- `struct PolymorphicIter<DATA: ?Sized> { alive:
IndexRange, data: DATA }` -- and unsizes a reference to it to `&mut PolymorphicIter<[MaybeUninit<T>]>`
for every operation. The unsizing coercion reads the **lockstep tails** for the metadata only
(`[T; N]` to `[T]` gives `N`) and leaves the record alone; fattening the tails themselves would
hand back a fat slice over the whole record, which the dereference on the other side then reads as
the struct it is.

Three projections read the shape, and they have to agree:

* a `Deref` names the record at `p.ptr` and keeps `p.meta` for later;
* the projection that reads the **tail field** is what turns the two halves back into a fat
  pointer: the field holds the elements and the metadata counts them, so the tail is
  `{ buf: p.ptr.data, off: 0, len: p.meta }`. Only a **slice** tail is built this way, because
  `[T; N] -> [T]` is the only coercion that makes a record with a tail out of a sized one. The
  steps that can sit between the two -- a transparent field, a downcast, a cast that changes
  nothing -- produce no JavaScript and carry the metadata along;
* `PtrMetadata` is `p.meta`, and `size_of_val` is the sized prefix plus `meta` elements of the
  tail.

`examples/core-tests/28_array_into_iter.rs` is the fixture.

#### The heap half

A `Rc<[T]>` allocates one of these rather than coercing to one, and the block it allocates is a
header plus the tail. A JavaScript array holds one element type, so the block is laid out with the
header **as element 0** and the tail after it:

```js
[ { strong, weak }, t0, t1, ..., t(len-1) ]
```

and the side table remembers where the tail starts (`hdr`). `*mut RcInner<[T]>` is then
`{ ptr: { buf, off: 0 }, meta: len }` -- the same two keys again -- and the two projections fall
out of the layout: `strong` is `p.ptr.buf[p.ptr.off].strong`, and the tail is the ordinary fat
slice `{ buf: p.ptr.buf, off: p.ptr.off + 1, len: p.meta }`. Every `{ buf, off }` the model already
builds works over that tail unchanged, which is the point of putting the header first: an offset is
a new record, a write is an assignment, a subslice moves `off` and `len`.

So the `.ptr` half is the record for a **reference** and a slot for a **raw pointer**, which is the
ref/raw split every other aggregate pointee already has ("References and raw pointers").

The reshape is `__rt.retype_rc(p, header_mk, tail_es, len)`, and it accepts the two states `alloc`
actually arrives in: `allocate_for_slice` casts the fresh block to the element type first, so the
block has already been uniformly retyped, while `allocate_for_ptr_in` goes through
`with_metadata_of` and arrives byte granular. `header_mk` is a factory for the header record, for
the same reason the zero element factory is one: only the compiler knows what the sized fields of
`RcInner` are and what a zero one of each looks like.

`examples/core-tests/29_rc.rs` is the fixture: the sized surface first, as the pin, and the tail
after it.

Only a **slice** tail is built. A `str` or a `dyn` tail is a run of nothing a JavaScript array can
hold, and it is refused with the type named
(`examples/core-tests/guard_rc_str.rs`); `Rc::into_raw`/`Rc::from_raw` are refused with it, because
`byte_sub(data_offset)` steps backwards across the header boundary and this model has no offset
that crosses from a tail element to the record in front of it.

### Casts

One function owns the matrix, `ptr::cast_pointer`, and every pointer to pointer cast reaches it:
`PtrToPtr`, `FnPtrToPtr`, `ArrayToPointer`, `MutToConstPointer` and the pointer arms of a
`transmute`.

| from -> to | result |
|---|---|
| either side is a `str`, from a slice of one byte elements | `__rt.bytes_str`; see "`str` is a hybrid" |
| same size, same indirectness | identity, which covers `*const T` to `*mut T` and the **layout-identical newtype** below |
| zero sized pointee on the target side | the **reference form** of the source pointee: `&T`, which is the object for an aggregate and the slot for a primitive |
| zero sized pointee on the source side | the way back, the raw pointer that reference form denotes |
| aggregate to its single non zero sized field | reproject: `{ buf: p.buf[p.off], off: "<field>" }` |
| size N to size 1 | `__rt.scale`: a scaled slot over the same buffer, and an address unchanged |
| size 1 to size N | `__rt.unscale`, which throws on a misaligned offset |
| element to array of elements | a window slot |
| array of elements to anything | `__rt.unwindow`, then the element's answer |
| anything else | a zombie at the cast, naming both types |

The array rows come before the size rows, and `__rt.unwindow` is a question asked at run time: a
pointer to `[E; N]` is either a plain slot whose one element is the whole array or the window slot
an earlier cast produced over `N` consecutive elements of somebody else's buffer, and nothing in
the type says which.

`[u8; N]` and `uN` convert little endian **as values**, in the transmute lowering, not here: a slot
names a place, and no place in a byte buffer holds the integer those bytes spell. That is the form
`u32::from_le_bytes` and `fmt`'s `cast_array().read()` actually reach; a *pointer* cast between the
two lands on the last row.

A union with a single non zero sized field (`MaybeUninit<T>`) is **transparent**: it is represented
as that field, and `uninit()` is `undefined`. So is a **`repr(transparent)` struct**, which the
language guarantees is exactly its one non-1-ZST field: `NonNull<T>` *is* the pointer inside it,
`ManuallyDrop<T>` is its `T`, `NonZero<u32>` is a number. An ordinary newtype keeps its object
form: the guarantee is what this reads, not the field count.

One more shape is read the same way, and it is an **observation rather than a guarantee**. A
**layout-identical newtype** — a `#[repr(packed)]` struct with one non zero sized field, at offset
zero, whose size equals that field's — holds exactly its field's bytes and differs from a
`repr(transparent)` one in a single respect: its alignment is 1 rather than the field's. This model
has no alignment, so there is nothing left for the wrapper to be that its field is not, and it is
represented as its field.

`core::ptr::Unaligned<T>` is why the row exists. `read_unaligned` casts a `*const T` to a
`*const Unaligned<T>`, reads it and transmutes the wrapper away; `write_unaligned` wraps and writes.
Both become the identity — but **only** because the two sides also agree on the JavaScript *value*.
Answering the pointer cast alone would leave `write_unaligned` storing a `{ _0: n }` object into a
place the rest of the program reads as a number, which is a silent wrong answer rather than a
rejection. So the rule lives in the value model, where construction, field reads, cloning and the
cast all read it, and the cast row above then follows for free.

The check is deliberately narrow. `pack` is what separates this from every ordinary newtype: a
plain `struct Meters(f64)` is layout-identical to its field too and keeps its object form, because
nothing about it says the two are interchangeable.

`read_unaligned` still does not reinterpret a buffer. Reading four bytes of a `[u8; N]` as a `u32`
asks for an element that buffer does not have, and `__rt.unscale` refuses it at the cast whether the
read is aligned or not; `u32::from_le_bytes` is the spelling that works.

The two halves differ in one thing, and it is what the directness rule reads. A **union**'s value
may be nothing at all, so a transparent union is **direct** whatever its field is — a reference to
one is a slot rather than an object, for the same reason a pointer record is. That is what makes
`mu.write(v)` an assignment to `p.buf[p.off]`, which works over an uninitialized place and is seen
by every alias of it; a reference that were "the object itself" would have nowhere to point. A
transparent *struct* always holds its field, so it is direct exactly when the field is, and
`ManuallyDrop<Point>` is the object a `Point` is.

The chain is why the struct half matters. `core`'s `MaybeUninit<T>` is a union over
`ManuallyDrop<T>`, which is a `repr(transparent)` struct over `MaybeDangling<T>`, which is another
— so `MaybeUninit<u8>` is the bare number `5`, and a `[MaybeUninit<u8>; N]` is an array of bytes
that `slice_assume_init_ref` and `str::from_utf8_unchecked` can read as the bytes they are owed.
With the wrappers left opaque it was `{ value: { _0: 5 } }`, and every buffer `core::fmt` builds
its digits in held objects where bytes belonged.

### Addresses

`p as usize` is `__rt.addr(p, size_of::<pointee>())`. Every buffer is given a synthetic base of
`4096 * n` the first time it is asked about, kept in a `WeakMap` so that it never moves, and the
address of an element is `base + off * size`; a scaled slot's offset is already in bytes and is
added as it is, and a number is an address already.

The size does not always survive to the call. `<*const T>::addr` is written
`transmute(self.cast::<()>())`, so the pointee is `()` by the time the address is taken while the
offset is still counted in `T`s — which is why the erasing cast (`__rt.erase`) records the element
size on the record as `es`, and `addr` reads it in preference to the size it was passed. `es` is
inert everywhere else: a dereference is still `p.buf[p.off]`, which is what lets the erased pointer
`core::fmt` hands to a formatter be the `&T` that formatter expects.

The scheme is chosen for four guarantees, not for convenience:

- `is_null()` is false for every real pointer and true only for `null()`, because no base is zero;
- `NonNull::dangling()` is an alignment, always below 4096, so it never collides with a base;
- an address is a multiple of the element size, so alignment predicates answer correctly;
- `fmt::Arguments::as_str` tests `bits & 1` on an 8 byte element, so the answer is deterministic.

Addresses are **not** ordered across buffers in any way a program may rely on, and an address never
turns back into a dereferenceable pointer.

### Element offsets

`off` counts pointee units, which makes the offset operations exact in both worlds:

- `ptr::add`/`offset` produce a new record with `off + count`, written out inline so that the
  dereference that follows folds back to `p.buf[p.off + n]`;
- `ptr::wrapping_add`/`arith_offset` go through `__rt.offset(p, count, size)`, which tests the form
  at run time. That is the split: Rust requires the *strict* offset to stay inside an allocation, so
  a pointer that is an address cannot reach it without undefined behaviour, while the wrapping form
  is exactly what a program is allowed to use on `null()` or a dangling pointer — a slice of a zero
  sized element counts its length that way. An address moves by `count * size` and stays a number;
- `ptr_offset_from` is `a.off - b.off`, and `byte_offset_from` is `(a.off - b.off) * size`. An
  **aggregate** pointee goes through `__rt.offset_from` instead, because one of the two records may
  not know where it is: a reference to an aggregate is the object, so a raw pointer made from one
  that arrived as a value is a `__rt.box`, a buffer of one. The helper finds that object in the
  other pointer's buffer by identity — `choose_pivot` returns one of three `&T`s and asks which
  index it was, so every sort of a struct depends on it;
- `copy`, `copy_nonoverlapping` and `write_bytes` move and fill runs of *elements*: `count` is an
  element count for a slot, and a byte count over a scaled slot, which is divided by `sc`. An
  aggregate element is cloned on the way across, because a byte for byte copy is an independent
  value and assigning a JavaScript object would be an alias;
- `write_bytes` names a value for two pointees only: a one byte one, where the pattern *is* the
  value, and a zero pattern on any other scalar. An aggregate is a zombie, and a non-zero pattern on
  a wider pointee throws;
- `compare_bytes` goes through `__rt.compare_bytes`: two unscaled byte buffers compare exactly, so
  the byte length is the element count and the bytewise `PartialEq` of `str` and `[u8]` works; two
  scaled slots of equal `sc` compare element by element over `count / sc`, which is what makes
  `[i32] == [i32]` work; a mismatched pair throws;
- `raw_eq` is `===` on two scalars, and `every` over an array of them — a fixed size array compares
  through a single `raw_eq` of the whole array, so without that arm no `[T; N] == [T; N]` would
  work. An array of scalars has no padding, so element by element asks what the bytes would.

Equality and ordering are `__rt.ptr_eq` and `__rt.ptr_cmp`. `ptr_eq` is `===` first, `false` for a
non object, and a comparison of `buf`, `off` and `sc` otherwise; `len` is deliberately ignored, so
a fat pointer equals the thin pointer to its start. `ptr_cmp` compares `off` when both sides share
a buffer and the addresses otherwise, and returns -1, 0 or 1.

### `str` is a hybrid

`&str` stays a JS string, and the byte view is produced on demand:

- `as_bytes` is `__rt.str_bytes(s)`, which encodes the string to UTF-8 and returns
  `{ buf, off: 0, len }` over a **plain array**, the same kind of buffer every other `[u8]` is.
  `as_ptr` is the same call reduced to the slot `{ buf: __rt.str_bytes(s).buf, off: 0 }`, because a
  thin pointer carries no length. A four entry memo ring keyed by the string returns the same record
  for a repeated call, so pointer identity holds in practice; identity across independent calls is
  **not** guaranteed, and nothing may depend on it.
- `from_utf8_unchecked`, and a raw pointer whose pointee is `str` (`str::from_raw_parts`), are
  `__rt.bytes_str(buf, off, len)`.
- The metadata of a `&str` is `__rt.str_len(s)`, the UTF-8 byte length, with an ASCII fast path.
- Writing through a `&mut str` stays a zombie.

`ptr::cast_str` owns the whole matrix — `str` to `[u8]`, `str` to `u8`, a slice of one byte elements
to `str`, `str` to `str`, and a zombie for anything else with a `str` on one side — and every
pointer cast asks it before the size based matrix, because the sizes say nothing about a JavaScript
string.

The slice being decoded into a `str` may have **any one byte element**, not only `u8`. A one byte
slice is the one buffer whose element count and byte count are the same number, which is what lets
its `len` be read as a byte length, and two types qualify -- both of which are buffers of plain
JavaScript numbers, so `__rt.bytes_str` reads either:

- `u8` and `i8`. A signed element is accepted because the byte is the same byte either way; the
  decoder reads it through a `Uint8Array`, which is where the sign goes.
- a **fieldless enum with a one byte integer `repr`**, which *is* its discriminant (see
  "Enums"). A fieldless enum *without* an integer `repr` is a variant name rather than a byte, and
  is not a one byte element at all.

`core`'s `AsciiChar` is the second shape, and `[AsciiChar]::as_str` is the cast. It is on the static
call graph of every `char` formatted with `Debug`, and so of `str::slice_error_fail` — which means
of `&s[a..b]`, `contains`, `find` with a `&str` pattern, and the float formatter. All four work
because of this row.

The same enums **transmute to and from the integer of their own width**, as the identity; see
"Transmuting between an enum and an integer" under "Enums". That is how `escape_ascii` builds its
output (`u8` to `AsciiChar`) and how `core::mem::Alignment` is read as a `usize`.

### Runtime shim additions

```js
__rt.box(value)              // the slot a raw pointer to a bare aggregate names
__rt.addr(p, size)           // the synthetic address of a pointer
__rt.ptr_eq(a, b)            // whether two pointers name the same place
__rt.ptr_cmp(a, b, size)     // -1, 0 or 1
__rt.offset(p, count, size)  // the wrapping offset, for a pointer that may be an address
__rt.copy(dst, src, count, clone?)             // overlapping element move
__rt.copy_nonoverlapping(dst, src, n, clone?)  // the same without the overlap
__rt.write_bytes(dst, byte, count, zero?)      // repeat a byte pattern
__rt.compare_bytes(a, b, count)        // lexicographic byte comparison
__rt.read_array(p, n)        // the `n` elements at `p`, as a JS array
__rt.write_array(p, values)  // the write half of read_array
__rt.unscale(p, size)        // a scaled slot back to a slot, throws if misaligned
__rt.chunk_slice(p, n, w)    // a slice re-read at chunk granularity, throws if it is not one
__rt.unwindow(p)             // a pointer to `[E; N]`, as a pointer to its first element
__rt.thin(p, size)           // `from_raw_parts` with `()` metadata: the data pointer, un-erased
__rt.str_bytes(s)            // UTF-8 bytes of a JS string as `{ buf, off, len }`
__rt.str_len(s)              // UTF-8 byte length
__rt.bytes_str(buf, off, len) // UTF-8 bytes back to a JS string, `""` at length zero
```

`__rt.thin` is what `from_raw_parts` answers with when the pointee is **sized**: its metadata is
`()`, so nothing is being rebuilt and the result is the data pointer itself. The work is in the
erasure that pointer arrived through. `from_raw_parts` takes a `*const impl Thin`, and
`with_metadata_of` — which is how `byte_offset`, `byte_add` and `byte_sub` are all written — hands
it `self as *const ()`. For a `*const u8` that value is already the slot; for a `*const i32` it is
the scaled byte view `cast::<u8>()` produced, and keying it back into elements is the whole of the
round trip. Nothing in the type says which, so the record is asked, the same way `__rt.unwindow`
asks. `ptr_metadata` of a thin pointer is `undefined`.

### Still not supported

Each is a zombie, reported only if reachable: `ptr_mask` ·
byte punning between two pointees that are neither the same size nor a byte · `raw_eq` on an
aggregate other than an array of scalars, and `write_bytes` on any aggregate · writing through a
`&mut str` · reprojecting a pointer from a scalar to a wrapper around it, unless the wrapper is a
[layout-identical newtype](#casts) · reinterpreting an array at another element width (`[u16; 8]`
to `[u8; 16]`) · a `transmute` between an integer and a fieldless enum with **no** integer `repr`,
whose value is a variant name and so carries no discriminant to observe (see "Enums") ·
a struct with a **`str` or `dyn` tail** (`Rc<str>`, `Arc<dyn Trait>`), where a slice tail is
[supported](#the-heap-half) because only a run of elements can be laid out after the header ·
`Rc::into_raw` and `Rc::from_raw`, whose `byte_sub(data_offset)` steps backwards across that
header · `TypeId` equality · SIMD · `f16`/`f128` · threads.

What is **no longer** on that list, and was: `&s[a..b]` on a `str`, `contains`, `find` with a `&str`
pattern, `Display` and `LowerExp` for `f32`/`f64`, `{:?}` on a `char`, `escape_ascii` and
`escape_debug`, `str::parse::<f64>()`, `read_unaligned`/`write_unaligned`, and
`byte_offset`/`byte_add`/`byte_sub`. `Debug` as a whole is still out — `{:?}` on a `char` works
because it is reached as a concrete impl, while `#[derive(Debug)]` and `Result::unwrap` coerce to a
`&dyn Debug` and drag every `Debug` impl in the program into reachability.

#### The zombie census in `core` and `alloc`

The count is measured off the rlibs the sysroot was built from, which is where a zombie is
recorded: each object carries a `//# rcgjs:` footer, and the recorded messages are read back out of
it. **Seven** survive in `core`, in six groups, and every one is on this page. The census was
re-measured after the enum representation changed, after the unsized-tail reference form landed and
after its heap half did. `core` has not moved at any of the three: the "no integer `repr`" transmute
row above is reached by nothing in `core` or `alloc`, and neither half of the tail representation is
reached from `core` at all.

| count | zombie | why it stays |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `[u16; 8]` -> `[u8; 16]` (`Ipv6Addr`) | reinterpreting an array at another element width |
| 1 | `[u8; 16]` -> `[u16; 8]` (the way back) | the same |
| 1 | `[u8; 16]` -> `u128` (`TypeId`) | `TypeId` has no stable byte representation here |
| 1 | `*const ()` -> `[u8; 4]` | byte punning a pointer |
| 1 | `NonZeroCharInner` -> `char` | reached only from that type's `Debug` |
| 1 | `*const str` -> `*const ()` | a `str` is a JavaScript string, whose only byte view is the one `as_bytes` produces |

`alloc` adds **twenty**, in five groups, and none of them is reachable from `Box`, `Vec`, `String`,
`format!` or `Rc` -- which is what the core suite demonstrates:

| count | zombie | why it stays |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | `core::ffi::CStr` (size, metadata, rebuilding one from a thin pointer) | an unsized pointee whose metadata this model has no form for |
| 5 | `core::wtf8::Wtf8` | the same |
| 4 | pointer constants of type `*const ()` | a pointer in a constant with no provenance behind it |
| 3 | `RcInner<Wtf8>` / `ArcInner<Wtf8>` | a struct whose tail is neither sized nor a slice, so it has no run of elements to lay out |
| 2 | `*const str` -> `*const ()` | as in `core` |

The fourth row is what is left of the Rc group, and it is the boundary rather than the whole
feature: a heap block **is** reshaped into a header plus a slice tail now
([above](#the-heap-half)), so `Rc<[T]>` and `Arc<[T]>` work and the five casts that used to sit
here are down to the three whose tail is a `Wtf8`. `Rc<str>` is the same row from a program's side
and `examples/core-tests/guard_rc_str.rs` pins it.

None of them is reachable from string handling, formatting or slices, which is what the earlier
counts were dominated by. In particular there are **no** `u8 as char` zombies: that arm has been
answered in `rvalue.rs` and `intrinsics.rs` for some time, and any note claiming otherwise is stale.

Some failures are deliberately left to run time rather than reported as zombies, because the
program is only wrong if it reaches them: rebuilding a slice at another element granularity —
`align_to`, `as_chunks`, `array_chunks`, `chunks_exact` — which would need elements the buffer does
not have, and which has to be a run time refusal rather than a zombie because `align_to` is on the
static call graph of `Display for str` through `do_count_chars`, so rejecting it would reject
`write!` itself (`examples/core-tests/guard_as_chunks.rs` pins the abort, and the same guard is
what `str::find`/`split(char)` reach through `memchr` once a haystack is at least two `usize`s
long); dereferencing a scaled slot or an address; `__rt.unscale`
on an offset that is not a multiple of the element size; a `copy` or a `compare_bytes` between two
pointers whose scales disagree, or a byte count that is not a whole number of elements; a run that
reaches past the end of its buffer, which is undefined behaviour in Rust and here is the shape a
byte count over a buffer that does not hold bytes would take; `write_bytes` of a non-zero pattern
over a pointee wider than a byte; and an `addr`, `ptr_eq` or `ptr_cmp` on a record the *strict*
offset built from an address, which is the one silent wrongness the model has and is why those
three ask.

### A reference to a fixed size array

`&*p` where the pointee is `[E; N]` has to be an array **object**, because that is what a reference
to an aggregate is here. Which JavaScript value that is depends on the record, not on the type, so
`__rt.array_ref(p, n)` asks it, exactly as `__rt.read_array` and `__rt.unwindow` ask their version of
the same question:

* a **plain slot** holds the whole array as its one element, so that element is the answer. A place a
  write is about to put an array in -- a fresh heap block, which is what `Box::new([1, 2, 3])`
  allocates -- has nothing there yet, and handing back what is there is still right, because the
  write reaches the place through the pointer rather than through this.
* a **window** slot (what `as *mut [E; N]` produces) and a **slice** record (what
  `<&mut [T] as TryInto<&mut [T; N]>>` leaves its `len` on) both name `n` consecutive elements of
  somebody else's buffer, and at any offset. There is no array object there to hand back, so one is
  made whose `n` elements are `Object.defineProperty` accessors onto those places: a real array by
  `Array.isArray`, `length` and indexing, and a write through it is seen by every alias of the
  buffer, which a copy would not be. Memoized by buffer and offset, so two references to the same
  elements are the same object and pointer identity holds.

`itoa` is why this matters and `examples/core-tests/25_array_ref.rs` is the fixture: `itoa::Buffer` is
a `[MaybeUninit<u8>; 40]`, `Buffer::format` casts a pointer to it down to a shorter array, and the
integer writers convert `&mut buf[1..]` back to a fixed size array at a non-zero offset. Both reach
the aliasing case. Before this the emission was the plain-slot answer for all three shapes, which
silently handed the callee ONE ELEMENT where the array belonged: `serde_json` could parse integers
and not print them.

## Enums (stage 3)

An enum's JavaScript shape follows from its **declaration**, never from how a value of it is used,
so every part of the backend can ask the question of a type and get the same answer.
`backend/src/value.rs`'s `EnumRepr` is that question and this section is its specification.

| the enum | its JavaScript value | example |
|---|---|---|
| every variant fieldless, **with** an integer `repr` | the discriminant, as a plain **number** | `Ordering::Less` is `-1`; `AsciiChar::A` is `65` |
| every variant fieldless, **no** integer `repr` | the variant's name, as a bare **string** | `Sign::Pos` is `"Pos"` |
| any variant carries a payload | an **object**: `TAG` plus the active variant's fields | `Some(3)` is `{ TAG: "Some", _0: 3 }`; `None` is `{ TAG: "None" }` |

Tuple-variant fields are keyed `_0`, `_1`, ... as everywhere else. A field literally named `TAG`
is emitted as `TAG_` (`naming.rs`), so a struct variant can never overwrite the tag.

Three properties are worth stating, because code elsewhere depends on each:

- **A mixed enum keeps the object form for its fieldless variants too.** `Option<T>` is
  `{ TAG: "None" }`, not `"None"`. An enum with a payload is [indirect](#value-representation): a
  reference to one **is** its JavaScript object, and `*p = v` overwrites that object in place
  (`__rt.overwrite`). A bare string has no identity to overwrite, so `Option::take`, `replace` and
  `insert` -- every `&mut Option<T>` in `core`, and so every iterator adapter -- would silently fail
  to write through the reference. The alternative, making mixed enums *direct*, is correct but boxes
  every borrowed `Option` local in the program.
- **The encoding is total.** The empty variant is a value, never an absent one. There is no
  `None = undefined` sentinel, so a niched `Option<&T>` and an `Option<Option<&T>>` are told apart
  by construction, and an uninitialized place (which *is* `undefined`) is never mistaken for one.
- **A fieldless enum is a JavaScript primitive**, so it is **direct**: a reference to a local of one
  is a `{ buf, off }` slot and the local is boxed (`uses.rs`), exactly as for a `bool`. It also
  needs no copy (`Operand::Copy` of one is the value) and compares with `===`, which is what lets
  `==` on a fieldless enum be lowered at all. A zero sized enum stays indirect like every other ZST.

### Reading a discriminant, and switching on one

MIR types the result of `discriminant(x)` as an integer, so the backend has to decide per read
whether the **tag** or the **number** is wanted. `backend/src/tag.rs` is one pre-pass per body that
answers it:

- a local whose single definition is `discriminant(x)` of a tagged enum with more than one possible
  variant, and whose **every** use is a `SwitchInt` scrutinee, reads the tag: the value itself for a
  fieldless enum, `x.TAG` otherwise;
- **every other** discriminant read is the number, spelled by a chain over the variants
  (`x.TAG === "None" ? 0 : 1`). `E::A as i32` and `mem::discriminant` -- which may be hashed as well
  as compared -- both go through it, and for a `#[repr(int)]` enum it costs nothing because the value
  already *is* the number.

The classification is conservative towards the number, which is correct everywhere and merely
longer. It requires more than one *possible variant* rather than more than one variant: a layout
with one inhabited variant has no tag in the value at all, and `ControlFlow<Infallible, T>` -- two
variants, one layout, reached by every `?` in the program -- is exactly that case.

A `SwitchInt` over a tag becomes a `switch` on strings, with each case value looked back up as the
variant whose discriminant it is:

```js
switch (s.TAG) {         // switch (s) for a fieldless enum
  case "Nothing": ...
  case "Num": ...
}
```

The structurizer's decision tree is unchanged and still reports *ordering* tests (`Lt`, `Le`,
`InRange`) whenever the values it is partitioning happen to be contiguous -- an or-pattern like
`A | B => ..` really does produce one. Names have no order, so `emit.rs` spells those by listing the
variants the test accepts, as an `||` chain of `===` (or, negated, an `&&` chain of `!==`). The
numeric decision tree is untouched for integers, for `char`, and for `#[repr(int)]` enums.

### Transmuting between an enum and an integer

A fieldless enum with an integer `repr` **is** its discriminant, in this model as on a real machine,
so a `transmute` between it and the integer of its own width and signedness is the **identity** --
in both directions, and to a thin pointer as well (`NonNull::dangling()` is a transmute of a
`mem::Alignment` straight to a pointer). The widths and the signedness have to agree exactly.

A fieldless enum **without** an integer `repr` is a variant name, and the discriminant such a
transmute would be observing is not part of the value. No rule claims it, so it is a
[zombie](#the-zombie-census-in-core-and-alloc) rather than a guess. Nothing in `core` or `alloc`
reaches one: every fieldless enum they transmute has an integer `repr`.

The same rule is what makes a slice of one byte elements readable as text: a `[u8]`, an `[i8]` and a
slice of a fieldless one-byte `#[repr(int)]` enum are all buffers of JavaScript numbers, and
`__rt.bytes_str` reads all three. `[AsciiChar]::as_str` is the cast that needs it, and it sits on
the static call graph of every `char` formatted with `Debug`.

### The size of it, and why it ships by default

Measured with `scripts/measure-size.sh` and the dom suite, against the numeric-tag encoding it
replaced:

| | raw | gzip |
|---|---|---|
| measure-size table, readable | +1.5% | **+1.3%** |
| measure-size table, `js-minify=locals` | +1.9% | **+1.5%** |
| measure-size table, `js-minify=on` | +3.9% | **+2.3%** |
| the counter island (all modes) | 0.0% | **0.0%** |
| the 14 dom fixtures + the shim + `topcoat-dom` | -0.5% | **-0.5%** |

A variant name costs more than a small integer, and it lands entirely on enum-dense code: the
worst case is `04_enums`, a fixture that is nothing but enums, at +7.5% minified-gzip on a 630 byte
file. It is paid back by `mem::Alignment` ceasing to be an object, which deletes three separate
wrappers from the allocator path every `Vec`, `String` and `format!` program carries -- the shim's
`typeof` unwrap, the `Object.assign` clone chains around `layout.align`, and the two-sided `.$t`
comparison. That is why the dom suite came out smaller. Nothing that contains no enums moved by a
byte.

So the encoding is the default and there is no flag to turn it off: the regression is inside the
budget the change was gated on, the emitted JavaScript says what it means, and a string-tag union is
a shape a `.d.ts` can name.

## Hoisted constants (stage 1.5)

A value the program writes over and over is emitted **once**, as a module level `const`, and named
at every use. Two kinds qualify:

- **`#[track_caller]` locations.** `intrinsics.rs::caller_location_value` interns each distinct
  `(file, line, column)` under the key `loc\x01<file>\x01<line>\x01<column>` and emits
  `const loc$h<hash> = { file: "...", line: N, column: M };`, with the identifier at the call.
- **String literals of 32 bytes or more** (`constant.rs::HOIST_STRING_BYTES`), keyed by the text
  itself: `const s$h<hash> = "...";`. The threshold is not a break-even point for a string used
  once — it is where the strings that repeat start paying (panic messages, `unsafe` precondition
  texts). A JavaScript string is a value, so sharing one can never be observed.

The mechanism is the vtable machinery unchanged: `CguCx::hoist` calls `CguCx::intern`, so the item
is built once per codegen unit, and the use site is the constant's *identifier*, so `JsItem::new`
picks the edge up mechanically and the reachability pass keeps the constant alive exactly as long
as something names it. The new `ItemKind::Const` is a binding (`is_binding()`), so the link step
emits it before the functions that read it. A hoisted constant carries **no header comment** even
with `js-comments=on`: its debug path is its value spelled a second time.

**Determinism, and why cross-crate sharing works.** The name comes from `Namer::synthetic_name`,
whose FNV hash is fixed across compilers and crates, so two crates that hoist the same value emit
an item with the same name *and* the same text — which is the case `link.rs` drops silently. That
holds only if the two crates spell the key the same way, so the key may never contain a
`def_path_str` (`naming.rs` says why), and the file in a location key must be remapped
identically. Both compile scripts now pass `--remap-path-prefix "$root/="`, and the toolchain's
own `core` sources are already spelled `core/src/...`; the core suite exercises the result — a
location in `core` reached from a generic instantiated in both crates is emitted by both and
appears once in the program.

`-Cllvm-args=js-hoist-consts=off` restores the inline form, byte for byte, for bisecting. It is
**emit-affecting**: the sysroot has to be built with the same setting as the crate linking it.

Hoisting is a size win in raw minified bytes only where a value repeats. Measured against
`js-hoist-consts=off`, it costs 1-4% of the *gzipped* size everywhere, because a 16 hex digit hash
in a name is incompressible while the repeated literal it replaced was a back-reference; and it
costs raw bytes too on a fixture whose locations are all used once (`14_slices`: +5.6% minified).
The larger win in this area was `--remap-path-prefix`, which took ~90 bytes off every location
literal in the mini_core suite. A per-item reuse count (hoist a value an *instantiation* mentions
twice, which stays deterministic across crates, rather than one the codegen unit mentions twice,
which does not) is the follow-up that would make the flag pay in both metrics.


## Allocation (stage 3)

`alloc` is in the sysroot, and `Box`, `Vec` and `String` work. Everything below is how.

### The block

A heap block is a **JavaScript array**. `__rt` keeps a side table of what else is known about it,
a `WeakMap` keyed by the array itself, so a block nothing points at is collected with its entry:

| field | what it is |
|---|---|
| `bytes` | the byte capacity the `Layout` asked for |
| `es` | the size in bytes of the elements the array currently holds |
| `fresh` | whether the block has been [retyped](#retyping) yet |
| `zeroed` | whether it came from `alloc_zeroed` |

A pointer into a block is an ordinary `{ buf, off }` slot, so every operation the pointer model
already has works over it unchanged: an offset is a new record, a write is an assignment, a slice
is `{ buf, off, len }` over the same array.

A block is **born byte granular** — `es` is 1 — because a `Layout` is a size in bytes and nothing
at the point of allocation says what will be put there.

### Retyping

A block is **retyped exactly once**, at the first `*mut u8` to `*mut T` cast made while it is still
fresh. The array's length becomes the element count the byte capacity buys (`bytes / size`) and
`es` becomes that size.

This is sound because the bytes are *uninitialized*: there is nothing in them to lose. It is also
the only moment at which it is sound, which is why the fresh flag exists. `RawVec::allocate_in` and
`Box::new` both allocate and immediately cast, so the retype always happens before anything is
written.

The rule is one step wider than that, and the second step is what a `Rc<[T]>` needs. A block may be
**reshaped** into a header plus a tail -- element 0 the header record, the tail after it, `hdr` on
the side table -- and the full invariant is:

> at most one uniform retype, plus at most one struct reshape while the block is provably unwritten.

"Provably" is meant literally: `__rt.retype_rc` checks that every element really is `undefined`
before it moves anything, so a block something has already written to is a refusal rather than a
silently rebuilt one. The two steps are separate because `alloc` performs them separately --
`allocate_for_slice` casts the fresh block to the element type and only then asks for the struct --
and a reshape that arrives at a block still holding bytes is accepted too, because `with_metadata_of`
is the other way in. See "A struct with an unsized tail" under "Pointers" for the layout.

Asking for the size the block **already has** is free and is the common case, not the exception:
`RawVecInner` stores its buffer as a `*mut u8` and casts it back on every single access, so a `Vec`
runs through the cast once per element read.

### The zero element factory

A block from `alloc_zeroed` holds zero *bytes*, and a zero element is not always the number `0`: it
is `false` for a `bool`, `{ TAG: "None" }` for a niched `None`, `"A"` for a fieldless enum whose
zero discriminant is `A`, `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` for a struct. Only the
compiler knows which, so **the cast carries a factory for one** — `__rt.unscale`'s third argument,
either `() => <zero>` or `null`.

`backend/src/alloc_support.rs` builds it, by decoding an all-zero `Allocation` of the type exactly
the way a `static`'s initializer is decoded. A type the constant reader cannot decode gets `null`,
and a *zeroed* block cast to such a type is then a run time refusal naming it; a block that was
never zeroed is unaffected.

The factory is an arrow rather than a value because it is called once per element: two elements of
an array of structs have to be two objects, or a write through one would be seen through the other.

A cast whose element size does **not** change still has to fill a zeroed block, because a block is
born at `es` 1 and a one byte element is read at the size the block already has. `vec![false; n]` is
the whole of that case, and `__rt.retype` is the member that answers it; it is the identity for
every pointer that is not a fresh zeroed block.

### Freeing

`dealloc` unregisters the block and **poisons** it: the array is emptied, so every stale pointer
into it reads `undefined` rather than the value it used to hold. The block is also remembered as
freed, which turns the next cast through a pointer into it into a refusal that says so.

`realloc` resizes the **same** array. That is the whole point: a JavaScript array grows and shrinks
without moving, so every pointer already derived from the block stays valid and there is nothing to
copy. The new length is in elements at whatever size the block currently holds.

### Run time refusals

Each of these is an exception naming the mistake, not a zombie and not a wrong number, for the same
reason `align_to` is (see "Not supported"): whether a given pointer is a fresh block is a fact about
the value, not about the type, so it cannot be answered when the item is lowered.

- **retyping a block that is no longer fresh** at a different element size — the bytes have been
  written at one size and reading them at another is a reinterpretation this model cannot express
  (`examples/core-tests/guard_heap_retype.rs`);
- **a byte capacity that is not a whole number of elements**, and a byte offset that does not land
  on one;
- **a zeroed block whose element zero cannot be spelled**
  (`examples/core-tests/guard_zeroed_retype.rs`);
- **a cast through a pointer into a freed block**
  (`examples/core-tests/guard_use_after_free.rs`);
- **reshaping a block that has already been written**, or reshaping one twice at two tail element
  sizes -- the second half of the retype-once invariant above;
- `dealloc` or `realloc` of a pointer that does not name a live block.

### `Box` is its pointer

A `Box<T, A>` whose allocator is zero sized — which is every box in a program with one global
allocator — is represented as the pointer it owns, exactly as a `repr(transparent)` wrapper is
(`value.rs`). `Box<T>` is the slot, `Box<[T]>` is the fat slice, `Box<dyn Trait>` is the fat dyn.
Rust does not call a box transparent, because a box is a language item rather than a library type,
but it holds nothing else.

Two consequences the rest of the backend reads:

- a local of box type whose address is taken is **boxed** like any other local whose value is a JS
  primitive, and dropping one *is* taking its address, so `uses.rs` counts a `Drop` of a place with
  real glue as a bare borrow;
- a `Box<dyn Trait>`'s data half is the *reference* form of the concrete value, which for an
  aggregate is the object and no longer names the allocation. `__rt._put` therefore records where an
  aggregate stored into a heap block lives, so `__rt.box` hands that place back and the box can be
  freed.

### `String` is `Vec<u8>`

No special representation. A `String`'s bytes live in a heap block of one byte elements, and the
JavaScript string appears only when something derefs it to a `&str` — which `core` does through
`from_utf8_unchecked`, and this backend answers with `__rt.bytes_str`. `bytes_str` has an ASCII fast
path, which is what a program built out of `format!` actually hits.

### The string sink

Building a `String` a character at a time through the heap works, but it spends an array element per
byte and a UTF-8 encode per push. A **sink** is the direct route: a host side string builder that a
`fmt::Write` implementation pushes into, and one JavaScript string at the end. The handle is an
index rather than the builder itself, so the whole surface is `usize`-shaped and an `extern "C"`
declaration can name it:

```rust
unsafe extern "C" {
    fn sb_new() -> usize;
    fn sb_push(handle: usize, s: &str);
    fn sb_push_char(handle: usize, c: char);
    fn sb_take(handle: usize) -> &'static str;
}
```

`sb_take` empties the sink, so a handle is reusable. The `'static` is a convenient fiction: a
JavaScript string is a value, owned by nobody. `examples/core-tests/prelude.rs` wraps the four in
`JsStr`, and `23_format.rs` is the golden.

### Host collections

`std`'s `HashMap` is `hashbrown`, and `hashbrown` cannot be compiled by this backend. Its group scan
reads sixteen control bytes as one wide integer and punnes the result back to a bitmask, and its one
allocation holds control bytes and table entries at **two element granularities**. A heap block here
is a JavaScript array of one element type and is retyped exactly once, so both are run time refusals
rather than slow paths (see "Retyping" and "Run time refusals" above). No amount of work on the
allocation model changes that: it is the same reinterpretation `guard_heap_retype.rs` pins.

The host already has a hash table. `topcoat-js` is the crate that hands it to Rust as
`topcoat_js::collections::{HashMap, HashSet}`, and `examples/core-tests/30_hashmap.rs` is the
golden.

**A `HashMap<K, V>` IS a host `Map`.** `repr(transparent)` over a one word handle, exactly as
`view_abi::Node` is over a DOM node: the JavaScript value the backend keeps in a local of that type
is the `Map` object itself. There is no handle table, no side allocation and no `Drop`; nothing
frees a map but the engine's collector, which is what makes moving one into a struct, into a
closure or through a function free and identity preserving. A `HashSet<T>` is a `HashMap<T, ()>`
under the same wrapper.

**A key is a JavaScript value a `Map` compares by value.** A `Map` compares with SameValueZero,
which is by value for a number, a BigInt, a boolean and a string, and object *identity* for
everything else. So the key classes are exactly:

| Rust | crosses as | note |
|---|---|---|
| `i8`..`i32`, `u8`..`u32`, `isize`, `usize` | a number | |
| `i64`, `u64`, `i128`, `u128` | a **BigInt** | equal by value; `5n` is not `5`, but one map has one key type |
| `bool` | a boolean | |
| `char` | a number | the code point, as everywhere else in the value model |
| `str`, `&str`, `String` | a string | one class, so the three are interchangeable |

Floats are excluded, for the reason `core` gives them no `Eq`. Everything else is excluded because
the entry would be filed under the object that carried the key and never found again by an equal one
built later, which is a silent wrong answer with nothing reported anywhere.

**The refusal is a type error, twice over.** `topcoat_js::collections::MapKey` is sealed, so an
aggregate key is rejected at the call site with the key type named, before any code is generated;
`examples/core-tests/guard_map_key.rs` pins that message. `backend/src/map.rs` carries the same rule
again as a post-monomorphization check on the marker's key argument, which is unreachable through
that crate and exists for a marker any other crate could call.

**`MapKey::Class` is what a key compares as**, and a lookup takes the class rather than the key
type: `String`, `&str` and `str` all have `Class = str`, and every other key is its own class. So a
`HashMap<String, V>` is read with `map.get("name")` and never needs a `String` built to ask a
question. A `String` key is decoded to a host string on the way in (one `__rt.bytes_str`), so the key
the map holds and the `String` that carried it part ways immediately: dropping the `String` frees its
heap block and leaves the map's key standing.

**A stored value is the `Option<V>` holding it, built on the Rust side.** Nothing hands the host a
bare `V`. This is what keeps the shim from ever learning what a Rust value looks like, and it falls
out of "Enums": an enum with a payload-carrying variant is always an object and always
[indirect](#value-representation), so `map.get(k)` of a present key is always an object, `&Option<V>`
is always that object, and the marker lowering is a plain call with no case analysis on `V`. The
three things that follow:

- `get`/`get_mut` are `Option::as_ref`/`as_mut`, so `&V` and `&mut V` come out in whichever of the
  two reference shapes `V` needs -- the object for an aggregate, a `{ buf, off }` slot naming the
  `_0` field for a primitive -- built by the value model rather than by the shim. A write through
  `get_mut` names the place inside the host object, so it is what the next `get` reads;
- `insert`'s old-value answer is `Option::replace` and `remove`'s is `Option::take`: safe code
  writing through an ordinary `&mut`, rather than a `ptr::read` a caller has to promise is a move;
- an absent key is never `undefined` reaching Rust. Every operation tests `map.has(k)` first.

**Iteration is over a snapshot.** `iter()` takes the keys once, as a fresh host array, and the
`__rt.map_keys` that builds it returns a **fat slice** (`{ buf, off: 0, len }`), which IS a `&[K]` in
the value model. So walking it is ordinary Rust indexing and the backend needs no arm for it. The
map cannot change while the iterator is alive, because the iterator borrows it; the snapshot is
therefore only visible as a cost, one array of `n` keys and one lookup per key. Order is the host's
insertion order, which `Map` guarantees.

#### The markers

Monomorphic operations are plain `extern "C"` declarations and reach `__rt` with no help from the
backend at all ("Calls to foreign items"). Only the operations generic over the key or the value
need one, because rustc has no generic foreign declaration, and those are markers in the same style
as `view-abi`'s: an ordinary Rust `fn` with an unreachable body, recognized by its `link_section`
before the callee resolves. The prefix is `rcgjs.map.` and `backend/src/map.rs` is the whole
lowering.

| section | lowering |
|---|---|
| `rcgjs.map.has` | `__rt.map_has(m, k)` |
| `rcgjs.map.set` | `__rt.map_set(m, k, v)` |
| `rcgjs.map.get` | `__rt.map_get(m, k)` |
| `rcgjs.map.getmut` | `__rt.map_get(m, k)`, the same read |
| `rcgjs.map.del` | `__rt.map_del(m, k)` |
| `rcgjs.map.keys` | `__rt.map_keys(m)` |

Two decisions are made there and only two. The **key crosses by reference**, because that is the one
shape covering both classes -- a `&str` already IS the host string and a `&u32` is a slot -- so a
slot shaped key argument is read through with `ptr::slot_element`, the same question
`text_conversion` asks of a `view_abi::text` argument. And the **key class is checked** after
monomorphization, reported as a zombie at the call site naming the type. A marker section the backend
does not know is a zombie naming the section, exactly as an unknown `rcgjs.tc.` one is; adding a
marker here bumps no version, for the reason the template markers give.

#### Runtime shim additions

```js
__rt.map_new()            // new Map(); the map IS the value
__rt.map_len(m)           // m.size
__rt.map_clear(m)         // m.clear()
__rt.map_has(m, k)        // m.has(k)
__rt.map_set(m, k, v)     // m.set(k, v), where v is the Option object Rust built
__rt.map_get(m, k)        // m.get(k), only ever called for a key map_has answered for
__rt.map_del(m, k)        // m.delete(k)
__rt.map_keys(m)          // { buf: [...m.keys()], off: 0, len }: a snapshot, as a `&[K]`
```

`scripts/make-esm-shim.mjs` needs no list to keep in step: it evaluates the shim and exports the keys
of the `__rt` it built, so these are in the ES module form by construction, and `jsc-build`'s
`shimcheck` reads that module's own exports.

#### Not supported

- **An `entry` API.** `or_insert_with` and friends would need a place a closure can be called into
  and a key held across it; the four call shape (`has`, `get`, `set`, `del`) has no room for it
  without a handle to a slot the map may rehash under. Deferred, not refused.
- **A key that is not one of the classes above**, including a float, a tuple, an array and any
  struct or enum. Sealed trait, plus the backend check.
- **`&mut` aliasing across a lookup.** Two `get_mut` calls for one key hand out two references to
  one place, and only the borrow checker stops that: the markers return a reference at a lifetime
  the caller picks, so `topcoat-js` narrows it to a borrow of the map at every call site and the
  markers are `unsafe fn` to say so.

### The allocator shim

`rustc_codegen_ssa` asks the backend to synthesize the `__rust_*` symbols `library/alloc` only
declares. `backend/src/alloc_support.rs` answers with real bodies over the heap above, following
`rustc_codegen_cranelift`'s `src/allocator.rs`: one function per `AllocatorMethod`, named
`mangle_internal_symbol(global_fn_name(name))`, parameters in `inputs` order with a `Layout` split
into its size and its alignment. cg_clif forwards every method to the `__rdl_*` wrapper `std`
defines; there is no `std` here, so the four methods rustc marks with a `SpecialAllocatorMethod` are
answered directly and only an unrecognized method still forwards.

**The alignment arrives as a plain number.** `Layout::align` is a `core::mem::Alignment`, which is a
`repr(transparent)` struct over a fieldless `repr(usize)` enum, and such an enum *is* its
discriminant (see "Enums"). So the parameter already holds the number `__rt` wants and there is
nothing to unwrap, which is also what makes a `transmute` of an `Alignment` to a `usize` the
identity.

`patches/0002-alloc-default-lib-allocator.patch` marks `alloc` as `#![default_lib_allocator]`, which
is what makes `AllocatorKind::Default` the kind a program using `alloc` gets, and so what lets an
ordinary `#![no_std]` crate allocate with no `#[global_allocator]` of its own.

An allocator shim is **not** a dead code elimination root, so a program that never allocates carries
none of it.

### Runtime shim additions

```js
__rt.alloc(size, align)                 // __rust_alloc: a fresh byte granular block
__rt.alloc_zeroed(size, align)          // __rust_alloc_zeroed: the same, filled with zero bytes
__rt.dealloc(p, size, align)            // __rust_dealloc: unregister and poison
__rt.realloc(p, size, align, new_size)  // __rust_realloc: the same array, resized
__rt.alloc_error(size, align)           // __rust_alloc_error_handler: diverging
__rt.unscale(p, size, mk)               // gains the zero element factory (see above)
__rt.retype(p, size, mk)                // the fill half, for a cast that changes no size
__rt.retype_rc(p, header_mk, es, len)   // the reshape into a header plus an unsized tail
__rt.unref(p)                           // the raw pointer a `&dyn Trait`'s data half denotes
__rt.unwindow_slice(p, len)             // the fat slice a raw `&[E; N] -> &[E]` produces
__rt._put(buf, off, value)              // the one element store, now also emitted by the backend
__rt.sb_new()                           // a string sink handle
__rt.sb_push(handle, s)
__rt.sb_push_char(handle, c)
__rt.sb_take(handle)                    // the finished string; the handle is reusable
```

`__rt._put` is what a write of a whole aggregate through a pointer becomes. It overwrites the object
in place wherever there is one, so every alias still sees the write, and stores where there is not —
which is what a fresh heap block needs, since `Box::new` writes the whole pointee into one.

## Modules (stage 3)

`-Cllvm-args=js-modules=esm` makes the program an ES module. The default is `script`, which is
everything above: a file that expects `__rt` to be a global and leaves its exported items as
globals for the host to call.

A module differs from a script in exactly two lines of the file.

```js
import * as __rt from "./shim.js";   // first, before every declaration
// ... every item, byte for byte what the script build prints ...
export { counter_clicked, rust_entry };   // last, after minification
```

**The `__rt` import.** Synthesized by the link step, not by codegen. It is deliberately not a
dead-code-elimination root: `refs` already reports `__rt` for every `__rt.foo(...)` call an item
makes, so the import is reachable exactly when something uses the shim and is dropped when nothing
does (`examples/emit/16_esm_no_shim.rs` is the fixture that pins the drop). `js-shim-module`
decides the specifier; it defaults to `./shim.js`.

**Imports are items.** `ItemKind::Import` is an item like any other, so it deduplicates, orders and
survives dead code elimination through the machinery that was already there. One item binds one
name and **the item's name is that binding**, which is what makes reachability work: an import is
kept when another item mentions what it binds. Two crates that import the same name from the same
module produce one item with one text, which the link step collapses silently; the same name from
two different modules is the existing `two different definitions of ...` error. An import item's
`debug_path` is the module specifier it imports from.

**Order.** Imports come first, sorted by `(module, binding)`; then the module level bindings in
dependency order; then everything else. That is one new tier on top of the order stage 1 had.

**Names.** An imported binding is never renamed, by either half of `js-minify`: the renamer
rewrites text, and renaming the binding inside an `import` would import a name the module does not
export. `_$` is reserved for the DOM runtime's bindings (`_$insert`, `_$template`), and no
generated local ever starts with it, so an imported binding cannot be shadowed either.
`js-dom-module` decides where those come from and defaults to `topcoat-dom`.

**The export clause** names the `#[no_mangle]`/`#[export_name]` items of the crate being linked, in
sorted order, in one trailing statement. One clause rather than an `export` keyword on each
declaration, and it is written after minification, so that no item's text depends on the module
mode. A dependency's exports are not in it, for the same reason they are not roots. The
`//# sourceMappingURL` line, when there is one, still comes last.

### Why `js-modules` is not emit-affecting

**An item's own JavaScript is byte for byte identical in the two modes.** Everything a module adds
is synthesized at link time, out of items the codegen step never saw. So a crate compiled with
`js-modules=esm` links against a sysroot built without it, and switching modes never costs a
sysroot rebuild — `scripts/test.sh` filters the module options out of the comparison it makes
against `build/sysroot/.js-args` for exactly this reason.

`scripts/module-test.sh` is what holds the invariant: it compiles every `examples/emit` fixture
both ways, checks the shape (imports first, one export clause, last line), strips those two lines
and diffs the rest against the script build byte for byte, then runs both and diffs what they
printed. If it ever fails, `js-modules` has become emit-affecting and the sysroot rule above is
wrong.

### The shim has two forms, from one source

`runtime/shim.js` stays a plain script: it assigns `globalThis.__rt`, it is concatenated ahead of a
script mode program, and pages load it with a bare `<script src>` and extend the object afterwards
(`demo/index.html` and `demo-app/src/glue.js` both do). A module cannot use that file — a
namespace import needs named exports — and one file cannot be both, because `export` is a syntax
error in a script.

So there is one source and one derived artifact, never two hand written copies.
`scripts/make-esm-shim.mjs` writes the module form: the shim's own text, verbatim, followed by an
export clause. The names in that clause are not a list anybody maintains — the script is evaluated
and the clause is written out of the keys of the `__rt` it actually built, so a member added to the
shim is exported by the next run and the two forms cannot drift. `scripts/run-esm.sh` derives it
into `build/esm/shim.js`, beside the program that imports it.

One consequence for a host: in script mode extra foreign items are added by assigning to
`globalThis.__rt` after the shim loads, and a module namespace object cannot be extended that way.
A module program's host passes `js-shim-module` a module of its own that re-exports the shim plus
whatever else the crate declares.

### Object file format version

An object file's `//# rcgjs:` item table now starts with a `u16` format version. postcard is not
self describing, so a table written in an older shape does not fail to parse — it parses into
something else, and the program that comes out is wrong rather than rejected. A mismatch is an
error naming the fix (`scripts/build_sysroot.sh --clean`). Bump `FORMAT_VERSION` in
`backend/src/item.rs` whenever the table's shape changes -- and also when the **JavaScript inside
it** changes incompatibly, which is the same failure one level up: an object holding the old enum
encoding would link cleanly against new objects and produce a program that is wrong rather than
rejected. Version 4 is the string-tag enum encoding.

## Chunks (stage 4)

`-Cllvm-args=js-chunk=<name>:<entry>`, repeatable, splits the program into one file per entry point.
`-Cllvm-args=js-chunk-shared=<name>` names the file holding what two or more of them reach; it
defaults to `shared`. Each chunk is written as `<name>.js` beside the output path, with its source
map as `<name>.js.map`, and the shared file appears only when there is something to share: its
absence is the answer "these chunks had nothing in common", not a missing output.

Chunks need `js-modules=esm`, because a chunk reaches the others by `import` and a script cannot.
Asking for them without it is an error rather than a silently unsplit program.

**The output path is unaffected.** A split is an *extra* emission: the file the compiler was asked
for still holds the whole program, byte for byte what it holds with no chunk asked for. That is what
keeps `--emit=obj` runnable, leaves every existing golden alone, and lets a build tool ask for chunks
before knowing whether there is anything to split. `examples/emit/20_chunk_one.rs` pins the
degenerate case: one chunk over the program's only root is the whole program back, differing only in
the header comment that names the file.

### Who owns what

Reachability is a pure walk over the item table, so a chunk is one more walk from one more root.
Every name reached gets exactly one owner:

1. a name that is some chunk's entry point belongs to that chunk, so `<name>.js` always exports the
   entry it was asked for;
2. a name only one chunk reaches belongs to that chunk;
3. a name two or more chunks reach belongs to the shared chunk;
4. an `ItemKind::Import` is the exception: it is **replicated** into every chunk that reaches it
   rather than owned by one. An import *declares* a binding the module has to have, so moving one
   into the shared chunk would leave a chunk calling `__rt.foo(..)` with no `__rt`.

A chunk then imports every name its own items mention that another chunk owns, and the owner exports
it. The shared chunk is closed under references -- everything an item two chunks reach can itself
reach is also reached by both -- so it never imports from a chunk and the module graph has no cycles.
Rule 1 is applied last, so an entry point another chunk also reaches stays in its own chunk and the
other chunk imports it: island-to-island falls out of the same mechanism as island-to-shared instead
of being a broken edge case.

### The cross-chunk specifier is relative

```js
import { lib$impl_1_get$h22b2.., lib$impl_1_set$h75b7.. } from "./shared.js";
```

**Relative, not the bare chunk name, and that is a decision rather than an accident.** Every chunk is
published into one directory, so a sibling path is correct wherever the files are served from and
needs no import map entry to resolve -- in a browser and under node alike. A bare specifier would
need one, and the prefix that map is written with belongs to the build tool: it is configurable
there, and the compiler is never told what it is. A chunk therefore cannot spell it.

The consequence for a build tool: with chunks in a subdirectory of where the shim is published,
`js-shim-module` must be an absolute URL, a bare specifier, or a relative path that accounts for the
extra level. The default `./shim.js` resolves inside the chunk directory.

### Minification across chunks

The item rename is computed **once** over the concatenation of every chunk and applied to each, so a
name that crosses a file boundary is spelled the same way on both sides of the boundary. Both ends
are ordinary text -- the `import { .. }` clause and the `export { .. }` clause are scanned like any
item's code -- so nothing special is needed to keep them in step. The exported names of the program
itself are unaffected: those carry a fixed name, which minification never touches.

An unsplit program is renamed exactly as it was before chunks existed, because the corpus is then
that one program.

### Zombies name the chunk

With chunks, a zombie is reported by the first chunk that reaches it, and the report carries the
chunk's name beside the chain of items that made it reachable. So the question a split program
answers is "which entry point cannot be built", which is the useful one. Each is reported once
however many chunks reach it.

## Coroutines (stage 4)

An `async fn` is a coroutine, and after rustc's `StateTransform` pass a coroutine is **an enum in
everything but its type kind**: its layout is `Variants::Multiple` with a tag, its states are
variants, and the locals it holds across a suspension are per-state fields. So it needs no machinery
of its own, only answers from the value model.

Its JavaScript value is an object whose `TAG` is the state's **index** (`EnumRepr::State`), because
its states have no names to spell. Always an object and never the bare number: a coroutine holds its
upvars beside the tag from the moment it is built, and it is only ever reached through a `&mut`
(`Future::poll` takes `Pin<&mut Self>`), so a value with no identity to write through would be wrong.
The index is also the discriminant `SwitchInt` compares against, which is why the numeric decision
tree drives the resume unchanged.

**Two field spaces share the one object, and they must not collide.** With no state downcast a field
is an **upvar** -- the layout's prefix, exactly a closure's captures, keyed by index. Inside a state
it is a **saved local**, keyed `$s<n>` by the `CoroutineSavedLocal` the layout names it by and *not*
by the per-state field index: one local can sit at different indices in two states that both hold
it, so keying by the index would make one local read as another after a resume. That is a silent
wrong answer, which is what the separate key space buys.

Building one puts it in its unresumed state holding its upvars. Changing its state moves the tag and
leaves the saved locals where they are, because MIR writes the new state's fields as separate
statements and says nothing about the old ones.

### The executor

A future is driven by the `view-async` crate, and the division of labour is the point: **the poll
loop is Rust and only the scheduler is JavaScript.** A loop on the JavaScript side would have to
call `Future::poll`, which is monomorphized per future type and takes a `Pin<&mut Self>`, and this
value model hands out neither a monomorphized method as a callable nor a `&mut F` as its receiver.
Putting the loop in Rust shrinks the boundary to five markers, none of them generic over a future,
and puts the policy where it can be tested.

The shim's whole half is two members. `__rt.microtask(f)` is `queueMicrotask`. `__rt.settled(v, f)`
calls `f(x, true)` when `v` resolves and `f(e, false)` when it rejects, and queues `f(v, true)` for
a value that is not a thenable at all. Two decisions there: the thenable test is
`typeof v.then === "function"` and not upstream's `"then" in v` property test (CONTRACT-DOM 14.9),
because this one refuses to call what is not callable; and a rejection is delivered as a VALUE with
`ok === false` rather than left as a rejection, because the pinned runtime's error handling is
entirely synchronous and a rejection reaches none of it (CONTRACT-DOM 14.4).

On the Rust side, a module-level table holds one `Rc<Task>` per spawned future. **A waker's data is
a task ID, never a pointer**: `RawWaker` takes a `*const ()`, and handing out `Box::into_raw` would
ask this value model for a stable heap address, which is the part of it with the miscompile history.
A `usize` is a number here. One `scheduled` flag per task makes any number of wakes between two
polls cost one poll.

The owner is captured at `spawn`, before the first poll, and every resume runs inside
`_$runWithOwner`. That is not tidiness: the runtime's `Owner` is a module-level global restored in a
synchronous `finally`, so for a suspended computation it is gone by the time a continuation runs,
and a continuation without it reads signals without subscribing, registers cleanups that do nothing,
and creates effects nobody disposes (CONTRACT-DOM 14.3). Every one of those is silent.

An island's setup must stay synchronous whatever this does (CONTRACT-DOM 14.6), so the executor is
only ever reached from an event handler or an effect. That is a constraint the emitter does not
check and the crate documents; a continuation resuming after the hydration bracket builds fresh DOM
instead of claiming the server's, and reports nothing in a production build.

## Templates (stage 3)

A `view!` compiled for the client reaches the backend as calls to the marker functions in
`view-abi`, and the backend replaces them with dom-expressions emission. This is the seam where the
compiler meets the framework: everything above this section is about lowering Rust, and this is the
one place the backend knows what a framework is.

The reference the emitted calls are held to is `contract/CONTRACT-DOM.md` and the corpus under
`contract/fixtures/corpus/`. Both are read only from the backend's side.

### The markers

Each marker is an ordinary Rust function with an unreachable body, recognized by the
`link_section` it carries. Recognition happens in `abi.rs` **before** `is_foreign_item` and before
the callee resolves, because nothing else about the call is unusual: it would compile and it would
abort at run time.

| section | lowering |
|---|---|
| `rcgjs.tc.template` | interned `_$template` cloner, the walk, and the record its holes are filled through |
| `rcgjs.tc.hole` | one hole, written once |
| `rcgjs.tc.handler` | one hole, whose value is an event handler |
| `rcgjs.tc.effect` | one hole, driven by a closure |
| `rcgjs.tc.cond` | `_$memo` over a conditional's test, and an accessor that dispatches on it |

The backend reads `abi: u32` first and refuses a payload announcing anything but version 6, by
name. A payload it cannot read at all is a zombie at the call site naming the field that failed,
never a panic in the compiler.

**Adding a marker does not bump the version.** The version describes the shape of the payload and of
the value model, which is what an old backend cannot cope with silently. A marker section it has
never heard of is already loud: it reports "`rcgjs.tc.<name>` is not a `view-abi` marker this backend
knows", at the call site, naming the cause. So `etv` and `epd` were additive at version 4, and so
were the five executor markers; what took the ABI to version 5 is the two new handle TYPES,
`JsValue` and `Owner`, which are part of the value model rather than of the marker set, and what
took it to version 6 is the two template construction flags below, which are new payload fields.

An ABI bump does not move the sysroot. `ABI_VERSION` is read in one place, at a marker call site,
and `core`, `alloc` and `compiler_builtins` contain none: no rlib in the sysroot carries a
`TemplateData`. What decides whether an existing rlib is still readable is the object file's own
`FORMAT_VERSION`, which versions the item table, and it is unchanged. `build_sysroot.sh` is more
conservative than that and rebuilds on any change to the backend dylib, which is a build script
decision rather than an ABI requirement.

`rcgjs.tc.withowner` is the one lowering that needs a name the client ABI does not declare.
`getOwner` is one of its 48 exports and **`runWithOwner` is not**: it exists inside
`solid-js/web/dist/web.js` and is absent from that file's export clause, while `solid-js` proper
does export it. So a client DOM module owes `runWithOwner` beyond the 48, exactly as it already owes
`createSignal`, and both are re-exports of real `solid-js` exports rather than inventions.

The two event markers take the event **by reference**, unlike the signal markers, which take their
handle by value (see "The handles are transparent, and taken by value"). The reason the two differ:
a handler closure's parameter already is a `&Event` -- that is the only way an `Event` is ever
reached -- and a marker's arguments are read by the backend rather than interpreted by the value
model, so what arrives is the DOM event the runtime passed the closure. Taking it by value would ask
the value model to copy a value out of a reference it has no representation for. `Event` therefore
stays an opaque struct with no handle field.

`|| ""` rather than `?? ""` on the target value: a `&str` return promises a string, and an element
with no `value` (a `<div>` the event bubbled from) would otherwise hand Rust `undefined`, which
breaks the moment anything reads its length. The two operators cannot differ here, because they
disagree only on falsy values that are neither `null` nor `undefined` and `target.value` is always a
string, whose one falsy value is the empty string this substitutes anyway.

### A component hole

A component invocation is a hole of its own kind, and it is inserted exactly the way a dynamic
child is: no anchor when it is an element's sole child, before the `<!>` when it has siblings, and
between the `<!$>`/`<!/>` pair in a hydratable template. `HoleKind::inserts_a_node` is what the walk
planner and the target locator ask, rather than naming `Child` twice.

What the kind changes is that the value is wrapped in `_$createComponent`:

```js
_$insert(root, _$createComponent(() => card$fn({ title: name, count: 3 })), anchor);
```

Three things about that shape are load bearing.

- **`createComponent` is what nests the hydration keys.** It swaps `sharedConfig.context` for a
  child context, runs the call, and restores the parent's already-advanced counter
  (CONTRACT-DOM.md 9.5). Routing the call through it is the whole reason the client half needs no
  key bookkeeping of its own.
- **One argument, not two.** Upstream's `createComponent(Comp, props)` is
  `untrack(() => Comp(props || {}))`, so a one-argument call passes `undefined` and the thunk is
  invoked with `{}`, which it ignores. The props object is not lost: a Topcoat client component is a
  plain Rust fn taking one props struct, and a struct argument is a JS object keyed by field name,
  so the object is inside the thunk and the callee destructures it. That is the equivalence family
  07 is built on, and `contract/fixtures/corpus/deltas.json` predicted this exact shape.
- **A component reaches the backend through `component`, not `hole`,** for the reason given below
  for `handler`: `hole<V>` cannot call a `V`, so a component passed through it would arrive with its
  body, the component function, and everything the component calls all missing from the program.

### Text conversion

`text(v)` is the string a hole's value renders as. The backend sees the monomorphized `T`, so most
values need no formatting machinery: `str` is already a string, a reference is read through (which
is what makes `(*title)` unnecessary for a `&&str`), `bool`, the integers and the floats go through
`String(x)`, and a `char` goes through `String.fromCodePoint` because a `char` is a code point
NUMBER in the value model and `String(x)` would print the number.

Anything else is `T`'s own `Display`, and that is ordinary Rust rather than an emission: the call
goes to `view_abi::display_to_str::<T>`, which streams into the host string builder (`sb_*`, see
"Allocation") and returns the finished string. The marker's body names that function so the
collector walks into it, and the backend finds it beside the marker rather than by spelling a path.
`alloc::String` takes this path too: it is a `Vec` of bytes in the value model, not a JS string.

### Keyed rows

`push_keyed(&list, key, row)` appends a row matched to the row of the same key from the previous
render:

```js
__tc_rows.push(__rt.keyed_row("<crate>#<n>", <key string>, <row>));
```

The key is converted exactly as a `text` value is, so a key is compared by the text it renders as.
`__rt.keyed_row` keeps one `Map` per loop; the site is `<crate name>#<n>` rather than a bare number
because the counter is per codegen unit, and two loops compiled in different crates would otherwise
share one cache, which is a wrong-rows bug rather than a slow one.

This is a pragmatic reconcile and not the runtime's `_$mapArray`. A view's `for` is an eager Rust
loop, so every row is BUILT on every render and the row of a cached key is then discarded in favour
of the node that key already had. What it buys is node identity: reordering a list moves the
existing nodes rather than replacing them, so whatever DOM state they carry survives. The cache is
not pruned, so a key that stops appearing keeps its node alive. Keyed tracking that skips building
needs the collection handed over as a JavaScript value plus a row function the runtime calls, and a
Rust iterator is neither.

Two marker shapes exist for reasons that are not about what they emit:

- **`handler` rather than `hole`** for an event handler, because a marker's body is what makes the
  closure it is handed reachable: the monomorphization collector walks into a closure only through
  a call, and `hole<V>` cannot call a `V`. `handler`'s bound is `Fn(&Event) -> R`, and its body
  builds the event and calls the closure. The value is discarded, as a DOM listener's is.
- **`cond` rather than one closure over the whole conditional**, because a test buried in a closure
  that also builds the branches cannot be hoisted; see "Memo hoisting" below.

`list`/`push` is how a `for` is lowered, and the design is the one the corpus's own family 13 notes
call the structural match: the loop stays Rust. Its iterator is a Rust iterator, so nothing the
backend could synthesize would iterate it; instead the loop runs where it was written, appends each
row to the list, and the list of DOM nodes is one value `_$insert` takes. That renders a list rather
than tracking one, and `view_abi::list` says so: a keyed, per-row `_$mapArray` needs the collection
handed over as a JavaScript value plus a row function the runtime calls, and neither is expressible
while the iterator is a Rust one.

### Arguments the backend reads instead of lowering

Some marker arguments never appear in the emitted JavaScript: a `template` payload, which is
decoded at codegen time; a hole index, which is a compile time constant; the `&root` of a hole and
the `&list` of a `push`, which name something the backend is already holding; and a signal ordinal,
which is dropped. Nothing is left to consume the MIR that computed them, so `abi.rs`'s
`consumed_locals` drops it: the local carrying such an argument, and each local behind it, has its
assignment skipped. Such a borrow also forces no box; see "References and raw pointers".

The rule is narrow on purpose. A local qualifies only when it is assigned once, read once and
never borrowed, which means its one reader was the argument that was just consumed and its
assignment has nothing left to feed. The walk follows the moves and borrows an expansion writes and
stops at anything else, so a body this pass does not fully understand keeps every store it had.

This is what makes the payload `static` disappear. Nothing keys on it and nothing could: it carries
no attribute, and a structural match on its type would recognize a type rather than a use. What
removes it is the reachability pass in `link.rs`, which drops any binding no reachable item
mentions. The one thing that kept it mentioned was the dead store, and the dead store is gone.

### One decoder, two readers

`backend/src/constant/raw.rs` holds the byte level primitives: reading a scalar, decoding a
`Variants::Multiple` tag (direct and niche), and following the provenance and length behind a
`&str` or a `&[T]`. Two readers sit on it, and neither has a decoder of its own:

- `constant.rs` turns a constant into a JavaScript expression, which is what a `static` the
  program keeps needs;
- `constread.rs` turns the same bytes into a `ConstVal` the **backend** reads, which is what a
  `static` the backend consumes at codegen time needs.

A second, independent decoder is the failure mode this arrangement exists to prevent: it would
agree with the first on every case anyone tested and disagree on the one nobody did.

### The walk

A hole's `path` is a run of `c` (`firstChild`) and `n` (`nextSibling`). `Walk::plan` names **every
prefix of every needed walk** exactly once, which is both what shares work between two holes under
one element and what CONTRACT-DOM 3.2 describes: only nodes on the path to a dynamic position are
named at all.

A `Child` hole's walk reaches one of two things and the emitted call differs:

```js
_$insert(el, value)                  // the value is the element's sole child
_$insert(parent, value, anchor)      // the value goes before an anchor comment
```

The two are **indistinguishable from the walk alone**: `c` is both "the first child element" and
"the first child, which is an anchor", so the template's HTML is parsed and the node the walk
reaches is looked at. `template.rs`'s `Tree` is that parser: elements, text runs and the three
comment forms, over the closed grammar the emitter writes rather than over HTML in general. A walk
that reaches no node is a hole error naming the walk, never a guess.

The element an anchored child inserts into is the walk with its last descent dropped: an anchor is
a child position, so its walk is its element's walk plus one `c` and a run of `n`.

A hydratable template's walk moves over the **server's** nodes, and there the pair that brackets a
dynamic child has the rendered value between its two markers while the template says the markers are
siblings. Two things follow, and both are part of the walk rather than of the hole:

```js
$t1 = $t0.nextSibling;                     // the `<!$>`
$t2 = _$getNextMarker($t1.nextSibling);    // the `<!/>`, and the nodes between the two
$t3 = $t2[0].nextSibling;                  // whatever the template has after the pair
_$insert(parent, value, $t2[0], $t2[1]);
```

- **`_$getNextMarker` is handed the node after the `<!$>`**, never the marker itself. It scans
  forward for the matching `<!/>` counting nested pairs, so handed the opening marker it counts that
  one and runs off the end: the value's own nodes are not collected and the insert replaces what the
  server wrote instead of adopting it. One DOM mutation per dynamic text hole is the symptom.
- **A walk that continues past a pair re-bases on the `<!/>` the call returned.** Counting siblings
  from the `<!$>` lands inside the rendered value. So the closing marker is named by the call rather
  than by a `nextSibling`, and everything after it is walked from there.

Both are upstream's shape, node for node
(`contract/fixtures/upstream/__dom_hydratable_fixtures__/textInterpolation/output.js`); the one
spelling difference is indexing in place of `[_el$, _co$] =` destructuring, and the same two values
reach `_$insert` in the same order. Because the call is in the walk, a hole whose pair another walk
also needs shares one `_$getNextMarker`, exactly as two holes share a prefix.

`examples/dom-tests/18_hydratable` is the fixture, and its `after_two_holes` case is the one that
needs both rules: two dynamic children under one element with static text between and after them.

### Which sink a hole reaches, and what it is handed

`_$insert` takes a value **or** an accessor and subscribes to the accessor itself, so a reactive
child hole needs no effect around it and is handed `() => body(env)`. Every other reactive sink is
written inside an `_$effect` and is handed the call, `body(env)`, because what it writes is the
value the closure returned rather than the closure. An event sink is handed a function whether or
not it re-runs, because the sink is what calls it.

`_$classList` and `_$style` diff against what they returned last time, so a reactive one takes the
effect's previous value as a third argument: `_$effect(_$p => _$style(node, value, _$p))`. That is
upstream's shape for a lone diffing sink (CONTRACT-DOM 6.2).

### Template construction flags, and the SVG wrapper

`_$template` takes three booleans after the HTML, and the payload carries the two of them a Topcoat
program can reach: `is_import_node` and `is_svg`. `isMathML` is always false, because the emitter
knows its own namespaces and has no MathML lowering. The call is emitted with all three arguments
when either flag is set and with the HTML alone otherwise, which is what the reference compiler
emits (CONTRACT-DOM 2.4).

`view-dom`'s `Template::finish` decides both:

- **`is_import_node`** when any element in the template has a dashed tag name. The runtime then
  instantiates with `document.importNode` instead of `cloneNode`, so a custom element upgrades on
  insertion. The decision is per template, not per element: one dashed descendant flags the whole
  template.
- **`is_svg`** when the template's ROOT is an SVG-only element. `<svg>` itself is not one: it is an
  ordinary HTML element to the fragment parser, so a template rooted at one parses in the right
  namespace already and takes no flag. The element list is generated by `view-dom/build.rs` from
  `contract/fixtures/properties.json`'s `SVGElements`, the same extracted table the property and
  delegated-event classifiers read, so it is upstream's list rather than a copy of it.

**`is_svg` and the `<svg>` wrapper are one decision and must never be made by halves.** Under the
flag the runtime returns `t.content.firstChild.firstChild`, one level deeper than usual
(CONTRACT-DOM 2.2), because the template string is wrapped in a literal `<svg>` first. So
`Template::finish` writes the wrapper into the HTML, and `Template::tree` roots the walk at the
wrapper's first child to match. Hole paths are untouched: they stay rooted at the element that was
written, which is the node the runtime hands back.

Emitting the flag without the wrapper, or the wrapper without the flag, **silently yields the wrong
root node**. Nothing reports it. A walk read one level too high answers `kind_at` with the wrong
node kind, which turns an anchored child insert into a sole-child one and back, so the emitted call
is well formed and inserts into the anchor comment at run time.
`examples/dom-tests/24_svg_wrapper_walk.rs` is the pin: its `root_group` case is a shape whose two
readings differ, and its golden is what tells them apart.

The wrapper is closed, unlike the trailing tags a template may leave open, because the extra unwrap
counts on it. That makes it the one template string the reference does not minify all the way
either, which the L2 harness accounts for with a family-09 rule.

### Interning and declaration order

A cloner is a module level `const` interned on **the HTML text and the two construction flags**,
never a def path: two crates that build the same template must name one cloner, and a def path is
spelled relative to whoever printed it (see `naming.rs`). That is what makes the runtime's
per-cloner memoisation per template rather than per render (CONTRACT-DOM 2.1).

A template with neither flag keys on `tmpl\x01<html>` and a flagged one on
`tmpl\x01<flags>\x01<html>`, which cannot collide with it because a template's HTML always opens
with `<`. The flags belong in the key because they are part of the cloner rather than of the text:
two templates with one HTML text and different flags are two different construction routines, and
interning them together would give whichever was emitted second the first one's `importNode` or
unwrap depth.

Interning on the HTML means a cloner's *name* is a hash, and a name is what `link.rs` used to order
module level bindings by. The reference compiler declares one `_$template` per distinct string in
first-use order, and a trace numbers templates in declaration order, so the order is observable: a
permuted set of cloners shows up as a difference on nearly every record.

So a cloner carries a `SourceOrder`, the position of the `view!` that built it, and `link.rs` places
the bindings that carry one before the rest and in that order. It is the position of the macro call
rather than of the `static` the expansion generated, which is what "first use" means in the
reference output. Two more rules make that order the source's rather than an accident:

- **The earliest use wins.** A template several views build is interned by the first *codegenned*
  use, and codegen order is a symbol-hash order with nothing to do with the source. Every use offers
  its position (`CguCx::order_at_most`) and the smallest one stays. Only uses in one codegen unit can
  offer one, which with one unit per crate is every use in the crate.
- **Two templates of one view tie-break on the index the emitter numbered the payload with.** The
  span cannot answer this: a proc macro's output all carries the macro call's span, so every payload
  of one view has the same one. `__TC_TEMPLATE_2` is the third template the view mentions, which is
  where the reference declares it.

Adding the field and then the tie-breaker bumped the object file's `FORMAT_VERSION` to 3.

Runtime names are `ItemKind::Import` items from the `js-dom-module` specifier (default
`topcoat-dom`), one item per name, bound as `_$template`, `_$insert`, `_$effect` and so on: the
`_$` convention upstream's output uses, so a diff against the reference is about code rather than
spelling. They deduplicate, order and survive dead code elimination through the machinery
"Modules" already describes.

Because those are imports, **a program using templates must be compiled with
`-Cllvm-args=js-modules=esm`**. In script output an `import` is a syntax error in the file rather
than a wrong value, so the instantiation is refused with a zombie saying so instead.

### `delegateEvents`

Emitted with the instantiation, inside the compiled function, so the program keeps having no module
level side effects. The reference emits one call at the end of the module carrying the union over
every template; ours is one call per instantiated template that needs one, placed before its holes
are filled. Both register the same listeners. The event list is deduplicated and sorted by the
backend rather than trusted from the payload, because a duplicate would register one listener
twice.

### Reaching a handler's body

The monomorphization collector walks into a closure only through a call, so a closure handed to a
marker is collected exactly when the marker's body calls it. Every marker that takes one does:
`cond` calls all three of its closures, `effect` calls its own, and `handler` builds an `Event` and
calls the handler with it. `Event` is constructible only inside `view-abi`, which is what lets that
body exist at all.

So there is no walk of the backend's own here, and there was one: while a handler reached the
backend through the fully generic `hole<V>`, which cannot call a `V`, the backend re-walked the
body the way the collector would. That is gone with the marker that made it necessary. A handler
calling anything at all used to name a function no crate defined -- 17_signal's golden carried a
throwing stub for `Sig::set` -- and the marker is what fixed it, not a second collector.

A handler's parameter also has a type now, which is what lets one be written the way the corpus
writes it. `view-dom` normalizes three forms into `handler`'s `Fn(&Event) -> R`: a closure written
in place keeps its body and has a bare parameter annotated; a **name** is the function to call and
is passed through; any **other expression** is the body to run, which is what Topcoat's
`@click=$(count.set(1))` means, and becomes the body of a closure over the event.

### A thunk built inside a loop snapshots its environment

A closure reaches a marker as a **thunk**: `($a0) => body(env, $a0)` for a handler, `() => body(env)`
for an accessor, and the bare call `body(env)` where the marker writes inside an effect of its own.
`env` is the expression the closure's environment lowered to, which for a `move` closure over the
loop variable is the *binding* of a local.

Every local is declared once, in the function prelude ("Emitted JS shape"), so a `for` over the rows
of a grid assigns a fresh environment array to the same binding on every turn. An arrow closing over
that binding would read whatever the last turn left there, and every row's handler would act on the
last row. So a thunk whose creation site lies on a control flow cycle takes the environment as the
parameter of an immediately invoked wrapper:

```js
$t2.$$click = (($c) => ($a0) => per_row$closure_1($c, $a0))([picked, row]);
```

`$c` is in the `$` namespace the backend reserves for its own names, so it can never shadow a local.
Outside a cycle the arrow is emitted bare: nothing reassigns the binding, and the wrapper would only
be noise. The **call** form is never wrapped, because it runs before the loop moves on.

"Inside a cycle" is measured on the same graph the structurizer is handed -- the non-cleanup blocks
and the edges between two of them -- so it means the same thing here as it does in the emitted
JavaScript. It is not gated on `js-scoped-lets`, and it holds in the dispatch fallback too, where
every block shares one `switch` scope and the binding is even more obviously shared.

### The handles are transparent, and taken by value

`Node` and `Sig<T>` are both `#[repr(transparent)]` one-word handles, and the JS value the backend
keeps in one is a DOM node, a list of them, or the runtime's `[get, set]` pair. Transparency is what
makes that possible: in the value model an ordinary struct is an object keyed by field name, and a
value copied out of one is REBUILT field by field, so a handle copied by value would come back as
`{ handle: undefined }` and reading it would call `undefined`. Transparency makes both the field read
and the rebuild the identity.

`sig_get`/`sig_set` therefore take `Sig<T>` **by value**, and `Sig::get`/`Sig::set` take `self` by
value, which is why `Sig<T>` is `Copy`. The alternative fails in the other direction: a `&Sig<T>` is
a reference to a one-word primitive, so the value model boxes the local as soon as anything takes its
address and the marker is handed the box rather than the pair. Taking the handle by value removes the
address-taking, and a copy of a handle correctly names the same signal.

A non-`move` closure still captures a `Copy` handle by reference, so a local a closure reads does
box, and the read through it is spelled `env[0].buf[env[0].off]` -- the pair is read out of the box
before the marker sees it, which is correct but costs an indirection. Emitting a view's reactive-hole
and handler closures as `move` closures would remove it.

### Effect groups

Holes of one `effect_group` collapse into a single `_$effect` carrying a `_p$` previous-value
record, per CONTRACT-DOM 6.2:

```js
_$effect(_p$ => {
  let _v$ = first(env), _v$2 = second(env);
  _v$ !== _p$.e && (node.disabled = _p$.e = _v$);
  _v$2 !== _p$.t && _$setAttribute(node, "title", _p$.t = _v$2);
  return _p$;
}, { e: undefined, t: undefined });
```

Every reactive hole still arrives as its own marker call, so the effect cannot be written until
every write it carries is known: a hole of a shared group is buffered, and the last one of the
group to arrive emits all of them. `view-dom` groups the reactive binds of one element and puts a
child hole or an event hole in no group, so a group's holes are consecutive and an expansion fills
them in order. A group that never completed is a group whose writes were buffered and never
emitted, which is a miscompilation rather than a missed optimization, so `codegen_body` records a
zombie naming it.

A group of one stays a plain effect. A record with one key buys nothing, and it is also what
upstream emits.

Record keys come from upstream's frequency ordered alphabet (CONTRACT-DOM 6.3) and the
value locals are `_v$`, `_v$2`, and so on. Both are private to one effect, so any unique scheme
would be correct; matching upstream is what makes the emitted code diffable against the reference.
Upstream numbers `_v$` across a whole function and this numbers it per effect, which is the one
spelling difference left in the shape.

A note for CONTRACT-DOM's owners, unchanged from when it was found and repeated because nothing has
acted on it: **6.3's heading says "base 53" and the alphabet it quotes is 54 characters long.**
Upstream divides by `chars.length`, so the real base is 54; `record_key` follows the string, and its
unit tests pin `record_key(53) == "$"` and `record_key(54) == "te"`. `contract/` is read only from
here, so this is reported rather than corrected.

### Memo hoisting

A conditional's test is hoisted into `_$memo`, so an unchanged test does not rebuild the branch
(CONTRACT-DOM 6.4):

```js
$t0 = _$memo(() => test(env));
_$insert(root, () => $t0() ? then(env) : els(env));
```

which is the reference compiler's conditional
(`__dom_fixtures__/conditionalExpressions`) with its immediately invoked wrapper flattened: that
wrapper exists to make the memo's declaration an expression, and a statement position needs none.
The reference also writes `!!test`; here the test is a `Fn() -> bool`, so its value is already a
JavaScript boolean and the coercion has nothing to do.

What makes it possible is that the test arrives as a closure of its own, through `view_abi::cond`.
Handed one closure over the whole conditional the backend has no test to hoist, only a function that
computes a branch, and producing the shape above would mean splitting one MIR body into three.

Both spellings of a conditional go through `cond`: a markup-bodied `if`/`else if`, and a Rust `if`
inside `$(..)` whose branches are values rather than markup. An `else if` chain nests, the outer
`else` closure's body being another `cond`, which is how the reference nests its own memos too.

Two shapes are deliberately left as one closure, and `view_abi::cond` says why: a `match`, and an
`if let`. Their tests are patterns rather than booleans and an arm's body reads what the pattern
bound, so handing the test over separately would mean matching once to choose the arm and again
inside it to bind, which is a different program from the one that was written. Family 12's remaining
`memo` delta is exactly this.

### What version 3 of the ABI changed

Three defects the previous milestone found were in `view-abi`, and version 3 is those fixes. All
three were fixed in the ABI rather than worked around in the backend, and the backend workaround
each one had is gone.

**1. `Node` is a `repr(transparent)` one-word handle.** It used to be `Node(())`, zero sized, so a
template root passed as a value was folded to a constant and reached the backend as `undefined`:
every branch of a markup-bodied `if` or `match` built its template and then contributed nothing, and
an island entry point returned nothing. Both halves of the declaration are load bearing. Non-zero
sized, so the value survives; **transparent**, so the handle *is* its field, because an ordinary
one-field struct is an object keyed by field name here and a value copied out of one is rebuilt field
by field -- which turned a root passed through a `Node` into `{ handle: undefined }`.

**2. `handler` exists,** so a handler's body is reachable and its parameter has a type. See
"Reaching a handler's body".

**3. `each` is `list`/`push`,** so a `for` lowers. See "The markers".

### The suite

`examples/dom-tests/` holds one fixture per corpus family it mirrors, written against
`dom_view_client_only!` because the reference traces were recorded from the non-hydratable preset.
Each carries `NN.js.expected` and `NN.trace.expected`, and `NN.family` names the corpus family its
trace is compared against where one means the same thing.

Two fixtures mirror no family. `16_topcoat_spread` pins an emission shape the corpus writes with a
type the spike does not build. `18_hydratable` is the only one compiled with `dom_view!`, the mode an
island's client half uses: it pins the marker-pair walk described above, which is invisible in a
client-only template, and its `twelve_holes` case pins that nothing emitted depends on how hydration
keys are *spelled*. The client asks the runtime for them (`_$getNextElement`, `_$getNextMarker`),
which counts with `sharedConfig` and looks the node up in the registry the server's `data-hk`
attributes filled, so a change to the server's encoding cannot move a walk.

Compiling one needs two things the `core` suite never does: `view-abi` built by this backend into
an rlib, and `view-dom-macro` built by plain cargo **for the host**, because a proc macro runs in
the compiler's own process whatever `--target` says. `compile_core.sh` grew `--extern NAME=PATH`
and `--crate-type` for both. There is no pre-expansion step: rustc loads the host macro dylib and
compiles the fixture in one pass, and the output is byte for byte what expanding first produced.

L2 (trace parity, corpus README) is reported per family rather than allowed to fail the suite: a
difference there is a finding about two emitters and not necessarily a regression in this one.
`examples/dom-tests/deltas.json` holds the accepted ones and, deliberately, holds only differences
that are total and mechanical: a template spelling convention, a field the reference's own
execution fills with a healed free binding. A difference in what is **emitted** is never a rule.
Those are listed in that file under `$whatIsDeliberatelyNotHere`, per family, so that every line a
comparison still reports has a written cause: anchor placement (view-dom's, documented in
`view-dom/src/lib.rs`), Topcoat's write-once `(expr)` against JSX's always-reactive attribute,
`delegateEvents` placement, a `match`'s missing memo, a reference program written with a component
Topcoat has no form for (`<Show>`, `<For>`), and the cases a family has that no fixture here can
write yet. A delta that gets fixed moves to `$measuredAndRetired` with the measurement that pins the
fix, rather than being deleted.

## Declared JavaScript interfaces (`#[js_extern]`, stage 4)

A program declares an interface to hand-written JavaScript with the `js_extern_macro::js_extern`
attribute over a foreign block, and the backend emits the JavaScript operation each declaration
names.

```rust
#[js_extern(module = "chart.js")]
unsafe extern "C" {
    #[js(new = "Chart")]
    fn chart_new(target: JsValue, config: JsValue) -> JsValue;

    #[js(get = "Chart.version")]
    fn chart_version() -> JsValue;
}

#[js_extern]
unsafe extern "C" {
    #[js(method = "update")]
    fn update(chart: JsValue, data: JsValue);

    #[js(index = "data.datasets")]
    fn dataset_at(chart: JsValue, index: f64) -> JsValue;

    #[js(method = "getPoint", nullable)]
    fn get_point(chart: JsValue, index: f64) -> Option<JsValue>;
}
```

### Nothing foreign survives the expansion, and it must not

Each declaration becomes a **marker function**: an ordinary Rust `fn` with a body, carrying the
descriptor in a `link_section`, exactly as `view-abi`'s markers do. The block is written as a
foreign one because that is the shape the signatures suit, and rustc rejects the attribute on what
it looks like: *"the `link_section` attribute cannot be used on foreign functions ... this was
previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error"*. The
help text names the shape that works, and that is the shape the macro writes.

The call is intercepted in `abi.rs`'s `codegen_call`, in the arm beside the `view-abi` markers and
ahead of `is_foreign_item`, so the marker body is never reached. Every body is then unreachable
from anything and dead code elimination removes it, along with the `core::fmt` chain its
`unreachable!` would otherwise pull in.

### The descriptor

```text
rcgjs.ext.<version>.<shape><flags>.<module-len>,<name-len>.<module><name>
```

for example `rcgjs.ext.2.n-.8,5.chart.jsChart`. `<flags>` is a run of letters or `-` for none:
`n` is a nullable return and `g` is a path rooted at the global scope. The fields are length prefixed rather than
delimited because a module specifier holds `.`, `/`, `-`, `@` and `:` and a JavaScript name holds
`$` and `_`: no character is safely excluded from both, a delimiter would need escaping, and an
escaping bug is silent. Decoding is total, and the version is the first field read, so a descriptor
this backend does not understand is a zombie naming the descriptor rather than a guess.

The format lives in one file, `js-extern-macro/src/descriptor.rs`, which the macro compiles and the
backend includes with `#[path]`. A proc-macro crate can export nothing but proc macros, so sharing
it any other way would have meant a third crate carrying one file, and two copies of a format is how
a format drifts.

### The shapes, and where each is rooted

**Three roots exist and every declaration has exactly one:** the call's first argument, a module's
imported binding, or the global scope. A module specifier names the second, the `g` flag
(`#[js(global)]`) names the third, and the absence of both leaves a member shape on its argument.
A call and a construction have no receiver, so with no module they are already global and need no
flag. An index is the one shape a module specifier does not move: a collection is reached THROUGH
something, so `chart.data.datasets[k]` inside a block that names a package is the ordinary
declaration. The name is a dotted path walked from wherever it is rooted, so one declaration covers
a walk.

| `#[js(..)]` | rooted at | emitted |
|---|---|---|
| `call = "Chart.register"`, module given | the imported `Chart` | `Chart.register(a, ..)` |
| `call = "f"`, no module | a global | `f(a, ..)` |
| `new = "Chart"`, module given | the imported `Chart` | `new Chart(a, ..)` |
| `new = "EventSource"`, no module | a global | `new EventSource(a, ..)` |
| `method = "update"` | argument 0 | `a0.update(a1, ..)` |
| `get = "data.datasets"` | argument 0 | `a0.data.datasets` |
| `get = "Chart.version"`, module given | the imported `Chart` | `Chart.version` |
| `global, get = "dash.status"` | a global | `dash.status` |
| `set = "title"` | argument 0 | `a0.title = a1` |
| `index = "data.datasets"` | argument 0 | `a0.data.datasets[a1]` |
| `index_set` | argument 0 | `a0[a1] = a2` |

The flag exists because a member shape has an argument to fall back on and a call does not. Without
it, `#[js(get = "dash.status")]` with no module reads a property of ARGUMENT ZERO -- silently, since
a declaration taking no arguments gets `undefined.status` and one taking an unrelated argument reads
a property of that. `global` also CLEARS a block's module rather than sitting beside it, which is
what lets a browser global be declared inside a block that names a package; `#[js(global, module =
"x")]` is a spanned error naming both roots.

A call and a method are the same emission: the path's last step is called as a member, so a static
keeps its receiver. A walk is emitted step by step rather than collapsed, because each step is a
property read the interface may be doing deliberately.

A declaration that names a module binds it with an `ItemKind::Import`, whose local is keyed on the
module and the name together: two modules exporting `Chart` bind two locals, and two crates
importing the same `Chart` bind one, which the linker then collapses. Only the path's FIRST segment
is imported, because `import { Chart.register }` is not a thing anyone can write.

### Arguments pass through

The value model already spells a number as a number, a `&str` as a string and a `#[repr(C)]` struct
as an object keyed by field name, so a declared interface receives the arguments it was declared
with and nothing is marshalled. What a shape adds is position: the receiver, the key an index reads
and the value a setter writes are taken from the front of the argument list, and everything after
them is passed on in order. **Nothing is padded**: a declaration with fewer parameters produces a
call with fewer arguments, which a library that branches on `arguments.length` can see.

An opaque JavaScript value is declared on the Rust side as a `#[repr(transparent)]` struct holding
one machine word, for the two reasons `view_abi::Node` gives: a zero sized value is folded away by
MIR, and an ordinary one field struct is rebuilt field by field, so a JavaScript object passed
through one would come back as `{ handle: undefined }`.

### `#[js(nullable)]`

A declaration whose return type is `Option<T>` may say that the interface answers `null` for an
absent value. The emission holds the result in a temporary and tests it:

```js
$t0 = chart.getPoint(99);
_3 = $t0 == null ? { TAG: "None" } : { TAG: "Some", _0: $t0 };
```

The temporary is not an optimization: both arms read the value, and an interface may be called for
its effects as well as its answer, so a repeated expression would perform the operation twice. The
test is `==` rather than `===`, so a missing property (`undefined`) is `None` as well as an explicit
`null`. The two `Option` values are built by `value::enum_value` from the destination's own type, so
this lowering has no opinion about the `Option` encoding and cannot drift from it. A destination
that is not an `Option` is a zombie.

This is opt-in and per declaration, which is the whole difference from a sentinel encoding: nothing
about `Option` in general changes, and an interface that never returns `null` never pays for the
test.

### What checks it

`scripts/extern-test.sh` compiles `examples/extern-tests/` and diffs a golden, then runs
`scripts/extern-check.mjs`, which drives the compiled module against
`contract/fixtures/js-extern/chart-lib.mjs` -- a recording fake of an npm chart library -- and
compares the call trace with `contract/fixtures/js-extern/vectors.json` through the contract's own
`compareTrace`. The vectors were produced by executing a reference emission against the fake rather
than by transcribing one, so what the golden pins is what was emitted and what the vectors pin is
that it does what the reference does. A recorder is what makes the distinction a descriptor is
ABOUT into the thing being measured: against a real library, `new Chart(el, cfg)` and a
`Chart(el, cfg)` factory both produce a chart.

## Written JavaScript expressions (`js!{}`, stage 4)

A program writes a JavaScript expression in Rust source with the `js_macro::js` function macro, and
the Rust bindings it names are captured.

```rust
pub fn post(url: &str, content_type: &str, body: &str) -> JsValue {
    js! {
        globalThis.fetch(url, {
            method: "POST",
            headers: { "content-type": content_type },
            body,
        }).then(r => r.text())
    }
}
```

This is the sibling of `#[js_extern]` and not a replacement for it. A declaration names an interface
that already exists and is worth naming; a block is for the value that has no name, and the case
that produced it is above. `fetch(url, init)` takes an options object holding
`{ method, headers: { "content-type": .. }, body }`, and the value model makes a `#[repr(C)]` struct
an object keyed by FIELD NAME. `content-type` is not a Rust field name, and no `#[js(rename)]` fixes
it, because the object is a VALUE rather than a declaration. Before this, `topcoat-dom` declared one
host function whose whole job was to hold that object.

### The block is one expression, and it is not validated

`js!{}` produces a JavaScript expression, not a statement list. A `;` outside every bracket, or a
statement keyword at the outermost depth, is a spanned error; inside a function body written in the
block they are ordinary statements. What is checked is that, that every bracket balances, that no
string, template literal, comment or regular expression is left open, and that no name collides with
an emitted capture slot.

**The block is NOT checked to be valid JavaScript.** There is no parser in the macro and none in the
backend, so a malformed block is a syntax error in the browser rather than a spanned error in Rust.
That is an accepted trade-off, taken deliberately: the alternative measured was `boa_parser`, which
at this pin drags `boa_ast`, `boa_interner`, `boa_macros` and `icu` data for a question that needs
no grammar. If a parser is ever vendored into `contract/vendor`, a build step can parse every
emitted block and report at build time; the analysis below does not change either way.

### What is a capture, and what is not

Free variable analysis is a LEXER, `js-macro/src/lexer.rs`, with no dependency. It skips the four
places an identifier is not an identifier -- strings, template literals (which nest through `${}`),
comments and regular expression literals -- counts bracket depth, and knows the binding forms:
`let`, `const`, `var`, function parameters, arrow parameters, a function's own name, `catch`, and
`for` heads. Everything else identifier shaped is a capture, except:

| not a capture | example |
|---|---|
| a reserved word | `typeof x` |
| one of four host names | `globalThis`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `Infinity` |
| a property after `.` or `?.` | `r.text` |
| an object literal key | `{ method: "POST" }` |
| a name the block binds, where it binds it | `r => r.text()` |

**The failure direction is chosen and it is the loud one.** An identifier the lexer cannot classify
is reported FREE, becomes a real Rust identifier in the expansion, and is therefore a spanned
"cannot find value" from rustc rather than a capture that silently went missing.

A name the host supplies is reached through `globalThis`. That is a rule and not a shortcut around a
builtins list: a list would go stale against whatever the page loaded, and going through
`globalThis` makes every host name a block depends on greppable, which is what keeps "a free
identifier is a Rust binding" total.

**The object literal shorthand is a reference**, so `{ body }` is a capture. It is written out as
`{ body: <slot> }` rather than replaced in place, because replacing the token would have renamed the
key.

**Scopes, not a set of names.** `r => r.text()` needs `r` bound inside the arrow and free outside
one, so a bound name is bound over a region. A scope opens at `) =>`, at `ident =>`, and at the `(`
of a `function`, a `catch` or an object method shorthand; it ends at the close of a block body, or
for an expression body at the next `,`, `;` or non ternary `:` at the same depth.

**Regular expression against division: the lean is toward division.** JavaScript answers this from
the parser's state and a lexer has only what came before, so a `/` after something that ENDS A VALUE
divides and after anything else opens a regular expression. The genuinely ambiguous token is `}`,
which ends a value when it closed an object literal and does not when it closed a block, and it is
counted as ending one. Both mistakes are possible and they are not equal: reading a regular
expression as a division lexes the pattern as code and its identifier shaped pieces come out FREE,
which errors; reading a division as a regular expression swallows the code up to the next `/`, and
an identifier inside it disappears without a word.

### The two ways to write a block

A block is ordinarily written as tokens, and the macro reconstructs the JavaScript from them.
Rust's own lexer runs first, so a backtick never reaches the macro (`error: unknown start of token`)
and comments are gone by then. A block that needs either is written as a single RAW string literal,
whose contents are taken verbatim:

```rust
let greeting: JsValue = js! { r#"`hello ${name}`"# };
```

A plain `"..."` is an ordinary JavaScript string expression, which is what it looks like, so the two
forms are unambiguous. The reconstruction keeps ADJACENCY, which `Spacing::Joint` records: two
punctuation marks written together stay together and two written apart stay apart, so `?.` stays an
optional chain and `a - -b` does not become a decrement. Nothing else needs a space, because an
identifier or a literal after punctuation can never lex as part of it.

### The block descriptor

```text
rcgjs.js.<version>.<slots>.<text>
```

for example `rcgjs.js.1.2.fetch(_$js0,{body:_$js1})`. `<slots>` is how many captures the block takes,
which is also how many arguments the marker call carries. `<text>` runs to the end of the section and
so needs no length, because the three fields before it hold no `.`; it is escaped to one line, with
a backslash spelling `\\`, `\n`, `\r` and `\0` -- the last because rustc refuses NUL in a
`link_section` outright, and the rest so the section stays greppable in a fixture and readable in an
error message. The escape is reversed exactly, so nothing about the JavaScript is normalized in
transit.

The prefix distinguishes the three markers this backend intercepts: `rcgjs.tc.` is `view-abi`,
`rcgjs.ext.` is a `#[js_extern]` declaration, `rcgjs.js.` is a block. Decoding is total and the
version is the first field read, so a block this backend does not understand is a zombie naming the
block rather than a guess.

The format lives in one file, `js-macro/src/block.rs`, which the macro compiles and the backend
includes with `#[path]`, for the reason `js-extern-macro/src/descriptor.rs` does: a proc-macro crate
can export nothing but proc macros, and two copies of a format is how a format drifts.

**The slots are already substituted when the section is written.** The analysis lives in the macro,
which is where the spans are and so where an error can be reported; carrying the capture NAMES
instead would mean a second lexer in the backend to find them again, and two lexers that disagree is
a miscompile. What the backend receives is text with holes at fixed names.

### The transport and the emission

The macro writes a marker function inside the expression, carrying the descriptor in its
`link_section`, and calls it with the captures:

```rust
{
    #[cfg_attr(target_arch = "wasm32", link_section = "rcgjs.js.1.2....")]
    #[inline(never)]
    fn __topcoat_js_block<__JsBlock, __JsCapture0, __JsCapture1>(
        __js_capture0: __JsCapture0,
        __js_capture1: __JsCapture1,
    ) -> __JsBlock { ::core::unreachable!(..) }
    __topcoat_js_block(url, body)
}
```

The captures route through real identifiers, which is what makes an undeclared one rustc's error
rather than the macro's. The marker is generic so that a block takes captures of any type and
produces a value of whichever type its context infers; `js!{}` in statement position therefore needs
an annotation (`let _: () = js!{ .. };`), which is the price of not naming a return type.

The call is intercepted in `abi.rs`'s `codegen_call`, in the arm after the `#[js_extern]` one and
ahead of `is_foreign_item`, for the same reason: the marker is an ordinary Rust function with a body
and would otherwise resolve. `js_block.rs` decodes the section, lowers each argument with the
ordinary operand path, and emits an arrow that is called immediately:

```js
((_$js0, _$js1) => globalThis.fetch(_$js0, { body: _$js1 }))(url, body)
```

An arrow rather than a textual splice of the argument expressions. An argument is an arbitrary
expression: splicing would evaluate it once per occurrence, in whatever order the block happens to
name its captures, and would need the backend to print an expression to text and re-parenthesize it.
Binding is the operation a capture wants and JavaScript already has it. A block with no captures
needs no arrow and gets none.

### What a block costs

The text is `jsast::Expr::Raw`, and `minify.rs`'s local pass refuses to rename anything in an item
holding one, because it cannot see which names the text mentions. **A function containing a `js!{}`
block therefore keeps its long local names.** That is a real cost with a known fix -- hoisting a
block into an item of its own would confine it to that item -- and it is not paid until a block is
written.

The link time item rename is textual, and its soundness argument named the emitted text as having no
regular expression literals, no template literals, no single quoted strings and no block comments. A
block may hold all four. The pass still substitutes only an exact match against the item table, and
an item name carries a `$h` hash infix or is `$a` from the pass itself, so a block would have to
spell one to be touched.

### What checks it

`js-macro`'s own unit tests are the lexer's: strings, template literals and their nesting, comments,
regular expressions against division, parameters and their defaults, declarations and destructuring,
`for` heads and `catch`, property keys against ternaries and `case` labels, the shorthand, bracket
nesting, and every refusal.

`examples/emit/21_js_block.rs` is the end to end fixture, with a byte for byte golden over the
emitted JavaScript and its stdout under node: a block with no captures, numeric captures, the
unspellable key, a capture named twice, the shorthand, an arrow parameter that is NOT a capture, and
a template literal through the verbatim form. It is compiled against the real `core` (`.core`) with
`js-macro` built for the host, which is what `emit-test.sh`'s `NN.macro` companion is for.

`examples/async-tests/06_procedure.rs` is the motivating case running: `scripts/async-check.mjs`
installs `globalThis.fetch`, records the init object the compiled program built, and asserts the
method, the media type under the header name Rust cannot spell, and the argument array.
