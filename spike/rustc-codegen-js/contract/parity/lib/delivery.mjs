// demo-app/src/dom.rs holds the delivery constants -- the import map, the `_$HY`
// bootstrap, the loader module -- and one `#[route]` per URL the page
// references. Every one of them is load-bearing for hydration, and a harness
// that kept its own copy would keep passing while the served page broke. So the
// constants and the route table are both parsed out of the Rust source.
//
// This is not fussiness. Between this harness being started and being finished,
// dom.rs went from serving the runtime as three modules stitched by an import
// map (`topcoat-dom.js` re-exporting `solid-web.js` plus six names from
// `solid.js`) to serving one self-contained bundle. Nothing here needed
// changing, because nothing here names those files.
//
// The one thing NOT taken from dom.rs is the compiled island module, which is a
// build artifact. Its path contract is `locateIslandModule` below.
