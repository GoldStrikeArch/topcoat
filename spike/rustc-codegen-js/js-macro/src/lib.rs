//! Writes a JavaScript expression into a Rust one, so a program can build a value the Rust type
//! system cannot spell without a host function standing in for it.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let promise: JsValue = js! {
//!     globalThis.fetch(url, {
//!         method: "POST",
//!         headers: { "content-type": kind },
//!         body,
//!     }).then(r => r.text())
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! `url`, `kind` and `body` are Rust bindings in scope at the call, and they are CAPTURED: the
//! expansion passes them by value to a marker function whose [`link_section`] carries the
//! JavaScript, and the backend fills the block's holes with them. Nothing else in that block is a
//! capture: `fetch` is reached through `globalThis`, `method` and `headers` are keys, `r` is bound
//! by the arrow, and `text` is a property.
//!
//! Which is which is decided by a JavaScript lexer, [`lexer`], not a parser. An identifier it
//! cannot classify is reported as FREE, so it becomes a real Rust identifier in the expansion and
//! an unintended one is a spanned "cannot find value" from rustc rather than a capture that quietly
//! went missing.
//!
//! # What is a capture
//!
//! Everything identifier shaped except a reserved word, one of the four host names
//! ([`lexer::HOST_NAMES`]), a property after `.` or `?.`, an object literal key, and a name the
//! block itself binds. The object literal shorthand `{ body }` IS a reference and so is a capture;
//! it is written out as `{ body: <slot> }` so the key keeps its name.
//!
//! A host name is reached through `globalThis`. That is deliberate: a builtins list would go stale,
//! and going through `globalThis` makes every host name a block depends on greppable while keeping
//! the rule "a free identifier is a Rust binding" total.
//!
//! # The two ways to write the block
//!
//! Ordinarily the block is written as tokens and the macro reconstructs the JavaScript from them.
//! Rust's own lexer runs first, so a backtick cannot appear that way; a block that needs one is
//! written as a single RAW string literal instead, whose contents are taken verbatim:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let greeting: JsValue = js! { r#"`hello ${name}`"# };
//! ```
//!
//! A plain `"..."` is an ordinary JavaScript string expression, not the verbatim form.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! The block is not validated as JavaScript. There is no parser here and none in the backend, so a
//! malformed block is a syntax error in the browser rather than a spanned error in Rust. What is
//! checked is that the body is one expression rather than a run of statements, that every bracket
//! balances, that no string, template, comment or regular expression is left open, and that no name
//! collides with an emitted capture slot.
//!
//! A name the block BINDS is never a capture, in the region that binds it. Shadowing a Rust binding
//! with a parameter of the same name and expecting to capture it outside the arrow works, but doing
//! it the other way round does not: pick a different name.
