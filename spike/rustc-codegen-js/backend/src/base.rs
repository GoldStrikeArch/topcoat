//! Per-mono-item codegen: the MIR walk.
//!
//! One `Instance` becomes one [`JsItem`] holding one top level JavaScript function. Its MIR locals
//! become JS locals named `_0`, `_1`, ... — `_0` is the return place and `_1..=arg_count` are the
//! parameters — and its control flow graph becomes structured JavaScript:
//!
//! ```js
//! function name(_1, _2) {
//!   return _1 + _2 | 0;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The graph is rebuilt into loops, labeled blocks, ifs and switches by the `structurizer` crate:
//! `cfg_adapter.rs` turns the body into the graph it reads, this module runs it, `queue.rs`
//! rewrites the region tree that comes back, and `emit.rs` prints it.
//! `-Cllvm-args=js-structure=trampoline` forces the flat `switch (sel)` dispatch loop the spike
//! emitted for everything, which is also what an irreducible graph falls back to;
//! `-Cllvm-args=js-queue=off` turns the rewrite off, leaving one statement per MIR statement.
//!
//! All the cases of a dispatch's `switch` share one block scope, so every local is declared once,
//! at the top of the function, and the body only assigns to them. Hoisted temporaries
//! ([`FnCx::temp`]) and the structurizer's own (`emit.rs`) join that same declaration list, which
//! is why it is built *after* the body: by then the queue has run, and a local whose one
//! assignment moved into the one expression that read it has nothing left to declare.
//!
//! # The current span
//!
//! Lowering methods do not take a span. `FnCx` carries the span of the statement or terminator
//! being lowered in a `Cell`, and [`FnCx::at`] narrows it for the sub-expressions that know
//! better — a call argument, a constant. Threading a span parameter through fifteen signatures is
//! how the spike ended up reporting fn-level spans for operand errors: every caller that forgot to
//! narrow it silently passed `mir.span`.
//!
//! Places and operands live in `place.rs`, rvalues and operators in `rvalue.rs`, value
//! representation in `value.rs` and calls in `abi.rs`.
