//! Places and operands: the JavaScript that reads and writes a MIR `Place`.
//!
//! Value and reference representation is documented in `value.rs`.
//!
//! # Fat pointers
//!
//! Three pointee types are not a single JavaScript value, so a pointer to them carries metadata
//! beside the pointer (`unsize.rs` builds them, `vtable.rs` builds the vtable half):
//!
//! * `&[T]` / `&mut [T]` is `{ buf, off, len }` — a backing JS array, a start offset into it and a
//!   length. The offset is what makes `Subslice` a constant time projection: a subslice shares the
//!   same `buf` and only moves `off`/`len`, so a write through it is visible in the original.
//! * `&dyn Trait` is `{ ptr, meta }` — the concrete value and its vtable array.
//! * a reference to a **struct with an unsized tail** is `{ ptr, meta }` too -- the record and the
//!   length of the tail (`value.rs::unsized_tail`). This one is not the identity all the way
//!   through: a `Deref` names the record, and the projection that reads the tail field is where
//!   `meta` comes back to build the fat slice the tail's type is.
//!
//! `Deref` of the first two keeps the whole object: it is the place walk's *later* projections that
//! read `buf`/`off`/`len` or `ptr`. `&*p` where `*p` is unsized is therefore the identity, which is
//! exactly what MIR's `&raw const (fake) (*_1)` (`RawPtrKind::FakeForPtrMetadata`, the shape a
//! bounds check is built out of) needs it to be.
//!
//! # Slots
//!
//! Every other pointer is a `{ buf, off }` slot (`ptr.rs` owns the model), and a `Deref` of one is
//! `p.buf[p.off]` — an ordinary assignable JavaScript place, which is what lets the walk keep
//! going through a pointer without a special case for writing.
//!
//! Taking a reference is therefore the walk run *backwards*: the walk produces `A[B]` or `A.k`,
//! and `&place` takes it apart again into `{ buf: A, off: B }` or `{ buf: A, off: "k" }`. A slot
//! captures its key **by value** at the moment it is built, so `&mut xs[i]` keeps pointing at the
//! element `i` named then even if `i` moves afterwards; the accessor closures this replaced closed
//! over `i` instead, and needed the index hoisted into a temporary to be sound.
//!
//! A bare local has no container to be the `buf` of, so a local whose address is taken is
//! **boxed**: declared `let x = []`, used as `x[0]`, and pointed at with `{ buf: x, off: 0 }`. See
//! `uses.rs` for how that is decided and `base.rs` for where it is declared.
