//! Host collections: calling the `topcoat-js` map markers.
//!
//! `topcoat-js` gives Rust the host's own `Map` as a `HashMap`/`HashSet` (`CONTRACT.md`, "Host
//! collections"). Everything monomorphic about that is an ordinary `extern "C"` declaration and
//! reaches `__rt` with no help from here. What is left is the handful of operations that are
//! generic over the key or the value, which rustc has no foreign declaration for: those are marker
//! functions carrying [`MAP_PREFIX`] in their `link_section`, intercepted in [`crate::abi`]'s
//! `codegen_call` beside the `view-abi` markers and lowered here.
//!
//! # There is nothing to marshal
//!
//! Every marker is one `__rt` call with its arguments passed straight through, for the reason a
//! declared JavaScript interface passes its arguments through: the value model already spells a
//! number as a number, a `&str` as a string and an `Option<V>` as an object. Two things are
//! decided here rather than by the value model, and only two.
//!
//! * **A key arrives as a reference and the host wants the key.** A `&str` already IS the host
//!   string, but a `&u32` is a `{ buf, off }` slot, and handing a slot to `Map.set` would key the
//!   entry on a record nothing can ever produce again. So a slot shaped key is read through, which
//!   is the same question `text_conversion` asks of a `view_abi::text` argument.
//! * **The key's class is checked after monomorphization.** `topcoat-js` seals its `MapKey` trait,
//!   so an aggregate key is already a type error at the call site and this check is unreachable
//!   through that crate. It is here because the marker is an ordinary generic function that any
//!   crate could call, and because "the map silently never finds this key again" is the failure it
//!   would otherwise have: a host `Map` compares with SameValueZero, which is object identity for
//!   anything that is not a number, a string, a boolean or a BigInt.
