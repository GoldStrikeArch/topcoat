//! Whole-program linking: reachability, zombie reporting and emission.
//!
//! # What "linking" means here
//!
//! There is no linker. A program is the set of JavaScript items reachable from its roots, printed
//! in an order that respects module level initialization. So the link step is a graph walk:
//!
//! 1. collect every item from this crate's compiled modules and from each linked rlib;
//! 2. deduplicate — the same generic instantiation may be codegenned in several crates, which is
//!    fine as long as the two spellings agree, and an outright bug if they do not;
//! 3. mark the roots: the `#[no_mangle]`/`#[export_name]`/`#[used]` items **of the crate being
//!    linked** and any `--js-root=NAME`;
//! 4. breadth-first search over `refs` **intersected with the item table**, remembering which item
//!    first reached each one;
//! 5. report the zombies in reachable items only, each with the chain that made it reachable;
//! 6. print the reachable items, module level bindings first.
//!
//! Step 4 is where the naming invariants earn their keep: `refs` is every identifier the item's
//! JavaScript mentions, `Object` and `_3` and `bb` included, and the intersection is what turns
//! that into a call graph. See `naming.rs`.
//!
//! # Two entry points
//!
//! [`link`] is the real one, used for `--crate-type bin`/`cdylib`. Rlibs delegate to rustc's own
//! `link_binary`, which packs the objects into an archive for a later link to read back.
//!
//! [`prune_objects`] handles the single-crate `--emit=obj` path that `scripts/compile.sh` uses,
//! which never reaches [`link`] at all. It runs the same graph walk over the objects that were
//! just written and rewrites them in place, so a plain `rustc --emit=obj -o out.js` gets the same
//! dead-code elimination and the same zombie reporting as a real link.
