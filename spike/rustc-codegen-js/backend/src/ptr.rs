//! The pointer ABI: how a Rust pointer is represented in JavaScript, and the one place every
//! pointer producing part of the backend goes through.
//!
//! `CONTRACT.md`, section "Pointers", is the specification this module implements; the doc comment
//! on each function repeats the part of it that function owns.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! A pointer is a **slot**: a container plus a key, `{ buf, off }`, where `buf` is a JavaScript
//! array or object and `off` is a number index or a string property key. `off` counts *units of
//! the pointee type*, not bytes. Reading through the pointer is `p.buf[p.off]`, which is an
//! assignable JavaScript place, so a write through a pointer is an ordinary assignment and every
//! alias sees it.
//!
//! Every pointer producing operation either names a real slot or degrades to a provenance free
//! number, and nothing in between.
//!
//! # Forms
//!
//! | form | shape | what it is |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | slot | `{ buf, off }` | a pointer to one place; dereferenceable |
//! | scaled slot | `{ buf, off, sc }` | a byte offset view of a `sc`-sized pointee, from an `as *const u8` cast; **not** dereferenceable |
//! | window slot | `{ buf, off, w }` | a pointer to `w` consecutive elements, from an `as *const [E; N]` cast |
//! | fat slice | `{ buf, off, len }` | `&[T]`, `*const [T]` |
//! | fat dyn | `{ ptr, meta }` | `&dyn Trait`, where `meta` is the vtable array |
//! | address | a JS number | `null()`, `NonNull::dangling()`, `without_provenance`, an integer that
//!   was transmuted to a pointer; never dereferenceable |
//! | object | the pointee's own JS value | a reference to an aggregate, which keeps its identity |
//! | string | a JS string | `&str` |
//!
//! A slot record is **immutable**: [`add`] returns a new record rather than moving `off`. That is
//! what lets `value::needs_clone` keep excluding pointers.
//!
//! # References and raw pointers
//!
//! The two differ for aggregate pointees only:
//!
//! * `&T` and `&mut T` of an aggregate are the pointee's own JS object. Dereferencing is the
//!   identity, and mutation works because JS objects have reference semantics.
//! * `*const T` and `*mut T` of an aggregate are a slot. [`ref_to_raw`] of a bare object goes
//!   through `__rt.box`, a `WeakMap` keyed identity map, so that two raw pointers made from one
//!   object compare equal; [`raw_to_ref`] is `p.buf[p.off]`.
//! * For a pointee that is a JS primitive (a number, a `bool`, a `char`, a function pointer) there
//!   is no object to point at, so *every* pointer to it is a slot and the pointed-at local is
//!   boxed.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Wave 0 landed this API with the behavior the backend had before the slot model, so that the
//! parallel pointer workstreams have a stable surface to build against. A function whose body is
//! not the specification says so, in a `Not implemented yet` paragraph that states what it owes.
//! No function panics: an operation the backend cannot express records a zombie instead.

// Wave 0 lands the surface ahead of its callers; the wiring arrives with the workstreams that own
// each operation.
