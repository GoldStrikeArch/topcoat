//! Lowering of MIR constants to JavaScript literals.
//!
//! Scalars (integers, floats, `bool`, `char`), zero sized constants, the `&str` literals the print
//! shim takes, and the pointer constants that reach a `static` or a promoted aggregate. Anything
//! else the JS side would have to model as memory — a `&[u8]`, a vtable — becomes a zombie rather
//! than a silent miscompilation.
//!
//! Every function here takes the codegen unit (for the namer) and a [`ZombieLog`] rather than a
//! `FnCx`: constants are also lowered for `static` initializers, which have no function around
//! them. The span is threaded explicitly for the same reason.
//!
//! # Pointers into allocations
//!
//! A constant of pointer type arrives as an allocation plus an offset, and the allocation the
//! offset points *into* is named by the pointer's provenance. [`pointer_expr`] is the one place
//! that dispatches on it: a `static` becomes the module level binding it was emitted as, a
//! function becomes the emitted function, and an anonymous allocation is decoded back into the
//! value it encodes. Provenance also has to be consulted *inside* an allocation being decoded —
//! the initializer of `static S: &str` is a pointer and a length, and neither means anything
//! without knowing which allocation the pointer belongs to.
