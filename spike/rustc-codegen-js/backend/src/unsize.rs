//! Unsizing coercions: `&[T; N] -> &[T]` (slices) and `&T -> &dyn Trait` (trait objects).
//!
//! Representation contract (CONTRACT.md + plan):
//! - `&[T]` / `&mut [T]`  = `{ buf, off, len }`
//! - `&dyn Trait`         = `{ ptr, meta }` where `meta` is the vtable array
//! - a reference to a struct with an **unsized tail** = `{ ptr, meta }` where `ptr` is the record
//!   and `meta` measures the tail (`value.rs::unsized_tail`)
//! - dyn -> dyn upcasts consult `tcx.supertrait_vtable_slot`.
//!
//! The shape of the pass follows `rustc_codegen_cranelift`'s `src/unsize.rs`: strip the pointer,
//! compare the *tails* of the two pointee types (`struct_lockstep_tails_for_codegen`), and build
//! the metadata the target needs. What differs is that a fat pointer here is a JavaScript object
//! rather than a scalar pair, so a coercion is a small object literal and there is no `old_info`
//! to thread — a `dyn -> dyn` upcast simply reads `.meta` back off the value it was handed.
//!
//! A struct with an unsized tail is the one case where the lockstep tails are *not* what the
//! pointer becomes: the record stays whole and only its metadata is read off them.
//!
//! `&str` is deliberately absent: the contract keeps it a plain JavaScript string, so `&[u8] as
//! &str` and friends have no fat form to build.
