//! The one place that invents JavaScript identifiers.
//!
//! Every top level name the backend emits comes from a [`Namer`] method. Nothing else in the
//! backend builds an identifier out of a `DefId`, an `Instance` or a symbol name, because the
//! reachability pass in `link.rs` depends on a handful of invariants that only hold if names are
//! produced in exactly one place:
//!
//! * an item name never starts with `$` — that namespace belongs to compiler temporaries
//!   (`$v`, `$t0`, `$sel`), so a temporary can never be mistaken for a reference to an item;
//! * an item name never matches `^_[0-9]` — that is the shape of a MIR local (`_0`, `_1`);
//! * an item name is never `bb` — the trampoline's block variable;
//! * an item name is always a plain JavaScript identifier, never a reserved word.
//!
//! `refs` sets are collected mechanically from the emitted AST, so an item name that could collide
//! with a local would make a function look like it referenced something it does not.
//!
//! # Readable names
//!
//! The default ([`NameStyle::Readable`]) is a sanitized `def_path_str` plus `$h` and 16 hex digits
//! of a hash of the item's crate-independent identity ([`Namer::hash_key`]). The hash is not a collision *repair* — it is
//! unconditional, so a name depends on nothing but the item itself. A per-codegen-unit
//! disambiguation table would make the same item come out differently depending on what else
//! landed in its unit, which would break reproducible builds and cross-crate linking alike.
//!
//! `#[no_mangle]` and `#[export_name]` items keep their exact name: `scripts/entry.js` calls
//! `rust_entry()`, and the demo's button calls `counter_clicked(n)`. So do
//! `#[rustc_std_internal_symbol]` items, whose symbol is the only spelling the crate that declares
//! one and the crate that defines it can both arrive at — see [`Namer::has_fixed_name`].
//!
//! [`NameStyle::Mangled`] (`-Cllvm-args=js-names=mangled`) restores the spike's raw v0 symbols,
//! which is useful for telling a naming bug apart from a lowering bug.
