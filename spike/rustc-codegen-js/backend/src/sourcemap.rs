//! Source maps, version 3: the `.map` file that lets a browser step through the Rust.
//!
//! The map is assembled at link time, from the per item entries `item.rs` stores in each object
//! file. That is the only place it can be assembled: an item's line number in the finished program
//! is not known until the reachability walk has decided what is in it, and an item that came out of
//! an rlib was printed in a different compilation altogether. Rebasing is a single addition —
//! every item's JavaScript starts at the beginning of a line — so the entries an object carries are
//! line-relative and the columns are already final.
//!
//! # What the map says
//!
//! * `sources` are file names as rustc spells them in a diagnostic, so `--remap-path-prefix`
//!   applies. `sourcesContent` carries the text of every one this compilation still has in its
//!   source map — which is this crate's own files; a file that came from a dependency's rlib is
//!   `null`, and the browser is left to find it.
//! * `names` is the Rust name behind an emitted one: the function's def path, and every local whose
//!   spelling had to change (`self$1` for the second inlined `self`). Chrome reads the name off the
//!   mapping covering the identifier, which is why `jsast.rs` opens a fresh mapping right after one.
//! * every generated line gets a mapping at column 0. Firefox stops a mapping at the end of its
//!   line, so a run of lines from one Rust statement needs the mapping repeated (js_of_ocaml does
//!   the same, `js_output.ml`); and a line with nothing to say maps to
//!   [`GENERATED`], a source that exists only to be named in `ignoreList`. That is the blackboxing
//!   trick: the prologue, the dispatch scaffolding and the stubs are code no Rust programmer wrote,
//!   and a debugger that is told so steps over them instead of into them.
