//! The template ABI between `view!`'s expansion and the codegen backend.
//!
//! A `view!` template compiled for the client is communicated to the backend as a
//! plain `static TemplateData` passed as the first argument of the marker functions
//! below. The backend recognizes the marker `link_section` names, resolves the
//! argument to the static through its constant provenance, decodes it at codegen
//! time with its constant reader, and replaces the call with dom-expressions
//! emission. The static itself carries no attribute: rustc rejects a custom
//! `link_section` on a static holding references, and none is needed: the marker
//! call's argument is the join.
//!
//! Design rule this ABI is built against: every field must be decodable by the
//! backend's existing constant-reader primitives: scalars, `&'static str`,
//! `&'static [T]`, `#[repr(C)]` structs with named fields, and fieldless `repr(u8)`
//! enums with a direct tag. No `Option` of references, no trait objects, no function
//! pointers. Any shape change bumps [`ABI_VERSION`], and the backend refuses a
//! version it does not know by name at the call site.
//!
//! # Markers
//!
//! Every `pub fn` below is a marker: it carries a `link_section` the backend matches
//! on, and its body is unreachable. A marker is a Rust-ABI generic function on
//! purpose, so the backend sees a monomorphized instance per call site and can name
//! the argument types it needs to emit.
