// The dangling pointer
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `NonNull::dangling()` is an alignment held as a bare number, which is what
// `addr` reserves every address below 4096 for. That worked for as long as such
// a pointer was only ever compared against null -- and it is not. A collection
// that has never allocated holds one as its data pointer, so `Vec::new()`
// followed by `for x in &v` builds a fat pointer out of it (`{ buf: p.buf,
// off: p.off, len: 0 }` over a number) and gets `{ buf: undefined, off:
// undefined }`. `slice::Iter` then offsets that by the length, producing the
// poisoned `{ buf: undefined, off: NaN }` record `_named` refuses -- so
// iterating an empty `Vec` threw, on a program that is perfectly sound Rust.
//
// The fix is to give the dangling pointer a buffer of its own the moment it is
// cast to elements, rather than to teach every consumer about numbers. It is a
// FROZEN EMPTY ARRAY, one per alignment, so:
//
//   * two dangling pointers of the same alignment compare EQUAL (same buffer,
//     same offset), which is what makes `iter.ptr === iter.end` terminate the
//     loop on the first test;
//   * the strict offset builds `{ buf: <that array>, off: 0 + n }` rather than
//     a poisoned record, so nothing downstream has to know;
//   * `_named` keeps its job. The poisoned shape can still be built -- by
//     offsetting a real `without_provenance` address, which is the case Rust
//     genuinely forbids -- and that is now the ONLY way to build one, which is
//     what makes the refusal mean something.
//
// A dangling pointer is not dereferenceable, and the empty array is why: there
// is no element at any index. A program that reads one is already undefined
// behaviour in Rust, and reads `undefined` here rather than throwing. That is
// the one thing this trades away, and it is traded for `for x in v` over a
// `Vec` that has never allocated, which is ordinary code.
//
// `0` is not converted: that is `null()`, and `is_null()` is `addr(p) === 0`.

// reordering a list moves the existing nodes instead of replacing them, and
// whatever DOM state they carry (focus, scroll, a playing video) survives.
//
// One cache per loop, identified by the `site` the emitter numbers the
// `push_keyed` call with, so two loops never share rows. The cache is keyed by
// the key's text, which is what `view_abi::push_keyed` documents.
//
// The freshly built row of a cached key is DISCARDED, which is the cost of
// keying an eager loop and is documented as a delta against the runtime's own
// `_$mapArray`. The cache is not pruned: a key that stops appearing keeps its
// node alive until the program ends. Both are why this is called pragmatic.

// What is left is a scheduler and a promise bridge, and both are three lines.

// microtask(f): runs `f` after the current call stack unwinds and before the
// browser paints.
//
// `queueMicrotask` rather than a timer: the pinned runtime's own deferral is a

// inherited or is not callable passes it and then throws where it is called;
// this one refuses to call what is not callable. The difference is recorded in
// CONTRACT-DOM 14.9 and this is the safer half of it, which matters more here
// because the value comes from a declared interface rather than from a fetcher
// the runtime wrote.
//
// A non-thenable settles IMMEDIATELY and successfully, so awaiting a plain
// value works and costs one microtask. It is not called synchronously: a future
// that resolved without suspending would otherwise run inside its own first
// poll, which is the one place an executor must not run user code.
//
// The rejection arm delivers the reason as a value with `ok === false` rather
// than letting it stay a rejection. The pinned runtime has no asynchronous
// error path at all -- `catchError` and `ErrorBoundary` are synchronous
// try/catch -- so a rejection reaches nothing and becomes a host-level
// unhandled rejection (CONTRACT-DOM 14.4). Handing it to `f` puts it back
// inside the poll, where Rust sees an `Err`.
