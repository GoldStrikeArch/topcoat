#
# Builds a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` sysroot whose `core` was compiled by
# rustc_codegen_js, so that ordinary `#![no_std]` crates can be compiled to
# JavaScript against the real standard library core.
#
#   scripts/build_sysroot.sh            # incremental (cargo decides)
#   scripts/build_sysroot.sh --clean    # re-copy the sources and rebuild
#
# Set SKIP_BUILD=1 to reuse an already-built backend dylib.
#
# $JS_EXTRA_ARGS is passed on to the backend as `-Cllvm-args`, exactly as
# scripts/compile.sh does. Any option that changes what the backend emits has to
# be given to BOTH this script and the crate build that uses the sysroot, or the
# same instantiation comes out spelled two ways and link.rs rejects the program
# as two different definitions of one item. `js-names` and `js-structure` are the
# ones that bite; see CONTRACT.md. The sysroot is rebuilt from scratch whenever
# these change, because cargo's fingerprint covers rustflags.
#
# What it does
# ------------
#
#   1. copies `library/` out of the pinned toolchain's `rust-src` component into
#      build/stdlib/ — the toolchain's own copy is never touched, so a patch that
#      goes wrong cannot corrupt the installed sources;
#   2. applies every patches/*.patch, in name order, with `patch -p1` rooted at
#      build/stdlib (so a patch's paths start with `library/`);
#   3. builds `library/core`, `library/compiler-builtins` and `library/alloc`
#      with cargo, with `-Zcodegen-backend` pointed at our dylib;
#   4. installs the three rlibs into build/sysroot/, laid out the way `--sysroot`
#      expects.
#
# Why `compiler_builtins` too
# ---------------------------
#
# rustc injects a dependency on it into every `#![no_std]` crate that produces a
# final artifact, so a sysroot with `core` alone is rejected with E0463 before
# codegen ever starts. Nothing in it is ever *called* from emitted JavaScript —
# there are no `memcpy`s in a value model — but the crate has to exist. It is
# cheap: like every rlib it only codegens its non-generic items, and the ones
# this backend cannot express become zombies, which stay silent unless a program
# actually reaches them.
#
# Why `core` and `alloc` and not `library/sysroot`
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# `std` needs an operating system. `core` and `alloc` are what a program in this
# model can have: `alloc` brings `Box`, `Vec` and `String`, and every allocation
# it makes lands on the JavaScript heap the runtime shim keeps (CONTRACT.md,
# "Allocation"). `patches/0002-alloc-default-lib-allocator.patch` is what makes
# that heap the *default* allocator, so a crate using `alloc` needs no
# `#[global_allocator]` of its own.
