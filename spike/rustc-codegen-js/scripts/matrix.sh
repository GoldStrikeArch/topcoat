#
# Runs the runtime suite under every emission flag mode, and reports one table.
#
#     ./scripts/matrix.sh
#
# `G2-CHECKLIST.md`'s last structural finding is that this did not exist: "The 9
# flag modes are not encoded anywhere. There is no CI file, no Makefile and no
# matrix script in the spike ... A verdict claiming '46/46 across 9 modes' is
# claiming the result of nine manual invocations. Either write the matrix script
# or say it is manual." This is the script, so the claim is now a command
# somebody can run.
#
# # Why the modes are what they are
#
# One mode per INDEPENDENT decision the emitter makes, plus the default. Each
# changes the shape of the emitted JavaScript without changing what it means, so
# every one of them has to produce a program that behaves identically. A mode
# that only changes comments is still here: a comment writer that runs off the
# end of a statement run is a real defect, and it is invisible in any other mode.
#
# # The sysroot, and why the last line of this script matters
#
# `build/sysroot/.js-args` records the flags the sysroot was built with, and the
# framework's staleness check refuses a demo-app build whose sysroot disagrees
# with the flags it wants. A matrix run leaves the sysroot at whatever mode ran
# last, so this script ALWAYS finishes by restoring the default. Wave 5 hit this
# from the other side -- a demo-app build failed with `found "js-names=mangled",
# wanted ""` -- and the fix was to re-run the default by hand, which is a step
# nobody should have to remember.
#
# # `js-names=mangled`
#
# Included and expected to FAIL, at a pinned count. It has been broken since
# wave 3 and is listed in the OUT list; running it anyway is what keeps "broken"
# an observation with a number attached rather than a habit.
