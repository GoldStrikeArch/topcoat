//! The host `Map`, and the calls that reach it.
//!
//! Two mechanisms, and which one an operation uses is decided by one thing: whether it is generic.
//!
//! * A **monomorphic** operation is an ordinary `extern "C"` declaration. Every foreign call with a
//!   C ABI lowers to `__rt.<symbol>(...)` already (`CONTRACT.md`, "Calls to foreign items"), so
//!   these cost the backend nothing at all.
//! * A **generic** operation cannot be a foreign declaration, because rustc has no such thing. It
//!   is a marker function instead: an ordinary Rust `fn` with an unreachable body, recognized by
//!   the `link_section` it carries, exactly as `view-abi`'s markers are (`CONTRACT.md`,
//!   "Templates"). The prefix is `rcgjs.map.` and `backend/src/map.rs` is the lowering.
//!
//! # The value a map stores is an `Option`
//!
//! Nothing here hands the host a bare `V`. A map holds `Option<V>` and the host stores the object
//! that is (`CONTRACT.md`, "Enums"), which buys three things at the cost of one object per entry:
//!
//! * the host never has to know what a Rust value looks like, so the shim stays four lines of `Map`
//!   calls;
//! * `&Option<V>` is always an object rather than sometimes a `{ buf, off }` slot, so the marker
//!   lowering is a plain call with no case analysis on `V`;
//! * moving the old value out on `insert` and `remove` is `Option::replace` and `Option::take`,
//!   which are safe code writing through an ordinary `&mut`, rather than a `ptr::read` that the
//!   caller has to promise is a move.
