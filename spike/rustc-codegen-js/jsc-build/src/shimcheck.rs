//! The link-time check that every `__rt` member a chunk reaches for exists.
//!
//! # The failure this exists for
//!
//! The backend emits `__rt.<name>(...)` for every operation with no short inline
//! spelling, and `__rt` is whatever module the build named with
//! `-Cllvm-args=js-shim-module=<specifier>`. When that module is
//! `runtime/shim.js` the set is complete by construction, because
//! `scripts/make-esm-shim.mjs` derives the export clause from the object the
//! script actually installs. When it is a module the application wrote -- which
//! is what an island build does, because a shim is a global-scope script and an
//! island is a module -- nothing checks the two against each other.
//!
//! **A missing member is not a compile error. It is a `TypeError` the first time
//! that line runs**, in a browser, in whichever branch happens to reach it. Wave
//! 5 found it the way it is always found: the dashboard was the first island to
//! need `f2i` and `str_bytes`, and `demo-app/src/island-rt.mjs` still carries a
//! hand-written note saying to go and `grep` the emitted chunks for the next
//! one. That note is what this module replaces.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! For each published chunk: find the namespace import of the shim specifier,
//! collect every member read through the binding it introduced, and subtract the
//! module's exports. Anything left is reported, with the chunk it came from and
//! the module that was supposed to supply it, before the build succeeds.
//!
//! The binding is taken from the import statement rather than assumed to be
//! `__rt`, so a renamed or minified binding is still followed.
//!
//! # Why the export scanner refuses what it cannot read
//!
//! A check that silently sees no exports reports every member as missing, and a
//! check that silently ignores an export form it does not know reports the ones
//! declared that way. Both are worse than no check, because both are wrong in a
//! direction someone will work around. So [`exports`] handles the forms that
//! occur and returns an error naming the line for anything else, which fails the
//! build with a message about the checker rather than about the code.
