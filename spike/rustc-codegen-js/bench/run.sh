#
# One measurement pass of the real krausest harness, end to end.
#
#   bench/run.sh            # the real thing: 6 implementations, ~2 hours
#   bench/run.sh --quick    # a subset, minutes, for proving the pipeline
#
# Requires bench/setup.sh to have run (it clones and installs the harness and
# builds the four reference implementations). This script only ever handles OUR
# two entries, then drives the harness over all six and writes bench/RESULTS.md.
#
# WHAT IT NEEDS FROM THE ENTRY LANES
# ----------------------------------
# Two directories, each a complete krausest implementation (index.html plus its
# artifacts plus a package.json carrying a `js-framework-benchmark` block, which
# is what makes the server's /ls list it):
#
#   bench/vanilla/dist-krausest/    -> frameworks/non-keyed/topcoat-vanilla
#   ../demo-app/dist-bench/         -> frameworks/non-keyed/topcoat-island
#
# They are COPIED, not symlinked. A symlink would leave the benchmarked bytes
# changing under the harness while it runs, and would make "what exactly was
# measured" unanswerable afterwards; the copy is a snapshot, and `ls -l` on the
# framework directory dates it.
#
# WHY THE isKeyed GATE IS A GATE
# ------------------------------
# Both of our entries are submitted as non-keyed, and an entry filed in the
# wrong category is not a slow result, it is an invalid one -- the whole point
# of the keyed/non-keyed split is that the two are not comparable. The harness
# ships the detector upstream uses on submissions, so we run it as a hard gate
# before spending two hours: if it says an entry is miscategorised, or that its
# row HTML does not match the contract, nothing is benchmarked.
#
# WHY THE MACHINE HAS TO BE IDLE
# ------------------------------
# 03/04/05/09 run under a 4x CPU throttle and 06 under 2x, which means the
# benchmark deliberately makes the machine the bottleneck -- and anything else
# competing for it lands in the measurement multiplied by the same factor.
# Chrome also runs NOT headless on purpose (an occluded or backgrounded window
# gets its rendering throttled by the compositor), so the window has to stay
# visible and the pointer has to stay out of it. Hence the banner, and hence
# `caffeinate -dims`: a display sleep part-way through a two-hour run does not
# fail anything, it just quietly poisons the numbers after that point.
