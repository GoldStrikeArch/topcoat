//! `topcoat-vanilla`: the krausest js-framework-benchmark row store, compiled from Rust and
//! driving the DOM itself.
//!
//! There is no framework here and no client runtime. The whole benchmark app is this one
//! `#![no_std]` crate: it owns the row data in a `Vec`, it owns the `<tr>` elements in a second
//! `Vec`, and it reconciles the two with [`App::sync_view`]. What ships to a browser is this
//! crate compiled to JavaScript, the subset of the runtime shim it reads, and a bootstrap that
//! wires six buttons and one delegated click to the exported entry points. Every decision the
//! app makes is made in Rust.
//!
//! # The algorithm
//!
//! Non-keyed recycling, the same shape as the benchmark's own `vanillajs` non-keyed entry. A
//! `<tr>` belongs to a position in the table, not to a row of data: replacing the data rewrites
//! the text of the elements already there, a longer list appends clones of a template, and a
//! shorter one drops the elements off the END. So `run` twice clones nothing, deleting row two
//! shifts every later row's text up by one and removes the last element, and swapping rows one
//! and 998 writes four strings and moves no nodes. Those three are exactly what the harness's
//! `isKeyed` check looks at, and all three answer "not keyed".
//!
//! A row carries a dirty flag so that a sync writes only the cells whose contents changed: an
//! update of every tenth row is a hundred writes, not two thousand. The flag is set by whatever
//! changed the row and cleared by the write, which keeps `sync_view` the only place that touches
//! the table.
//!
//! # Crossing to the host
//!
//! [`JsValue`] is an opaque host value: one machine word so MIR keeps it, `repr(transparent)` so
//! it is the value rather than an object holding one. Every DOM operation is a `#[js_extern]`
//! declaration rooted at the global scope or at its first argument, so the emitted program
//! imports nothing and loads as a plain script.
//!
//! A `&str` crosses as a JavaScript string, and the `f64` overload of `textContent` crosses as a
//! number, so the id cell needs no formatting on either side.
