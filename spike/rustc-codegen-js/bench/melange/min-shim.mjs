// The smallest ES module shim a compiled program can be run against.
//
//   node min-shim.mjs <program.js> <out/shim.js>
//
// WHY NOT scripts/make-esm-shim.mjs
// ---------------------------------
// That script writes the WHOLE of runtime/shim.js plus an export clause -- 61 KB
// of it -- because it exists to run the test suites, where any member may be
// reached. For a size comparison that number is meaningless: the store below
// touches 23 members, and shipping the other sixty would be measuring the
// spike's test infrastructure rather than the program.
//
// So this walks the other way. It reads the `__rt.<name>` references out of the
// compiled program, closes them over the references those members make to each
// other, and writes only the statements that install them. What comes out is
// what a build tool would have to publish beside the program, and it is what
// the size table counts as our runtime.
//
// The idea is the one scripts/make-esm-shim.mjs and jsc-build's shimcheck
// already use -- the member set is READ, never maintained by hand -- with the
// direction reversed: shimcheck asks "does the shim have everything the program
// wants" and this asks "what is the least of the shim that answers that". Both
// FAIL on a member that is referenced and absent, which is the property that
// matters: a silently missing member is a `TypeError` at run time.
//
// HOW THE SHIM IS SLICED
// ----------------------
// runtime/shim.js is a plain script with a rigid top level shape: one object
// literal assigned to `globalThis.__rt`, then one `globalThis.__rt.<name> = ...;`
// statement per member, each preceded by its documentation as column-zero `//`
// comments. So a statement is "from its first line to the last line before the
// next one that is neither blank nor a column-zero comment", and the six members
// of the opening literal are lifted out of it into the same assignment form.
//
// The documentation is NOT carried over. That is deliberate and it is stated in
// the report: the comments are for a reader of the spike, not for a browser, and
// counting them would inflate our side of the table with prose. Nothing else is
// changed -- the member bodies are the file's own text, byte for byte.
