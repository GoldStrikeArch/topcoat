//! The krausest js-framework-benchmark non-keyed store, in Rust, compiled to JavaScript by
//! rustc_codegen_js.
//!
//! This is the Rust half of the core-logic comparison; `store.ml` is the OCaml half. Same data,
//! same operations, same order of side effects, no DOM on either side. What is being compared is
//! the store -- the part of a benchmark implementation that is actually written in the source
//! language rather than delegated to a framework.
//!
//! # What this crate is allowed to use
//!
//! `#![no_std]` with `extern crate alloc`, so `Vec` and `String` are the real ones out of the
//! sysroot and every allocation lands in the heap the shim keeps (CONTRACT.md, "Allocation").
//! That is deliberate and it is the expensive choice: an OCaml `string` is a JavaScript string
//! and a Rust `String` is a heap block of bytes, so the labels this builds are the part of the
//! comparison where the two models differ most. Measuring the cheap version instead -- keeping
//! labels as `&'static str` triples, say -- would be measuring a different program.
//!
//! The only foreign surface is two `#[js_extern]` declarations:
//!
//! ```text
//! #[js(call = "Math.random")] fn random() -> f64;
//! #[js(call = "Math.round")]  fn round(x: f64) -> f64;
//! ```
//!
//! Both are rooted at the global scope, so they emit `Math.random()` and `Math.round(x)` inline
//! and add no import to the module -- which is exactly what the OCaml half's
//! `external ... [@@mel.scope "Math"]` declarations emit. The two halves therefore draw from the
//! SAME generator, and a harness that installs one seeded function as `Math.random` gets
//! bit-identical work, and bit-identical labels, out of both. That is why the RNG is an extern
//! rather than a seeded PRNG written twice: a PRNG written twice is two pieces of code being
//! benchmarked in addition to the store, and it would have to be proven identical before any of
//! the numbers meant anything.
//!
//! # The store is a value, not a global
//!
//! There is no `static mut` here. `bench_create` returns a `Store`, and every operation takes it
//! back as `&mut Store`. In this backend an aggregate reference IS the object, so the value the
//! host holds between calls is the store itself and nothing has to be unwrapped -- the same shape
//! the OCaml half has, where `create ()` returns the record and every function takes it as its
//! first argument.
