(* The krausest js-framework-benchmark non-keyed store, in OCaml, compiled to
   JavaScript by Melange v7.0.1.

   This is the OCaml half of the core-logic comparison. store.rs is the Rust
   half: the same data, the same operations, the same order of side effects,
   compiled by rustc_codegen_js. Neither half touches the DOM -- what is being
   compared is the store, which is the part of a benchmark implementation that
   is written in the source language rather than delegated to a framework.

   IMPORT-FREE BY DESIGN
   ---------------------
   Melange's runtime lives in the `melange.js` opam package and is emitted as
   ordinary ES imports (`melange.js/caml_array.js` and friends). There is no
   opam here -- the compiler is the playground -- and those files are in no npm
   registry, so an output that imports one can neither be run under node nor
   honestly weighed: its real size would be its own bytes plus a runtime nobody
   present can produce.

   So every idiom below was chosen to emit no import at all, and
   `node extract.mjs` fails the build if one appears. What that ruled out, each
   verified against the v7.0.1 playground rather than assumed:

     * `a.(i)` and everything else in `Stdlib.Array`  ->  `melange.js/caml_array.js`
       (the bounds check is a runtime call). `Js.Array.unsafe_get/unsafe_set`
       are externals and compile to `a[i]`.
     * `Js.Math.random` and `Js.Math.round`  ->  `melange.js/js_math.js`. In
       v7 `Js.Math` is a module, not a wall of externals, so the two used here
       are declared locally with `[@@mel.scope "Math"]` and inline into
       `Math.random()` / `Math.round(x)` -- byte for byte the calls the
       reference implementation makes, and byte for byte what the Rust half's
       `#[js_extern]` emits.
     * integer `mod` by a NON-constant divisor  ->  `melange.js/caml_int32.js`
       (the divide-by-zero check). `mod_float` has no such check and compiles to
       `%`, so `random_below` does the remainder in float space and truncates
       once at the end -- see the note on that function.

   What survived unchanged is most of the language: records with mutable
   fields, `for`/`while`, `ref`, `^`, `int_of_float`, array literals. None of
   those costs an import.

   FAIRNESS NOTES (the ones a reader should be able to check)
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   * Both halves call the SAME `Math.random`. Neither seeds its own generator,
     so the harness can install one seeded function as `Math.random` and get
     bit-identical work -- and therefore bit-identical labels -- out of both.
   * The three `random_below` calls that build a label are bound with `let`
     rather than left as operands of `^`. OCaml does not specify the evaluation
     order of the arguments of an application and in practice evaluates them
     right to left, which would draw the noun's random number first and produce
     a different label than the reference for the same stream. The `let`s pin
     the order to the reference's left-to-right, and cost nothing: Melange
     inlines them straight back into the concatenation.
   * `Js.Array.push`, `Js.Array.concat` and `Js.Array.spliceInPlace` are
     externals over the real JS methods, which is what the reference calls. No
     OCaml list, no immutable copy: the container is a JavaScript array on both
     sides of the comparison. *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------ externals *)

(* `Math.random()` and `Math.round(x)`. Declared here rather than taken from
   `Js.Math` for the import reason above; the emission is identical. *)

   divisor pulls `caml_int32` in for its divide-by-zero check, and `mod_float`
   does not. `Math.round` already returns a whole number, so the float
   remainder and the integer one agree for every value that can occur, and the
   single `int_of_float` at the end is the `| 0` the reference's implicit int
   conversion performs anyway. Emitted:

     Math.round(Math.random() * 1000) % max | 0 *)
