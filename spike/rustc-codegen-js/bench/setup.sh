# This clones github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark into bench/krausest,
# installs it, and builds the four reference implementations our entries are
# measured against. It does NOT build or run anything of ours -- that is
# bench/run.sh. Run this once; run.sh many times.
#
# WHY THE CLONE IS PINNED
# -----------------------
# The number in RESULTS.md is only meaningful next to the harness that produced
# it: krausest changes the benchmark definitions, the Chrome flags and the
# reference implementations themselves over time, and a re-run six months from
# now against a moved upstream would silently be measuring something else. So
# the FIRST run records the sha it happened to get into bench/KRAUSEST_PIN, that
# file is committed, and every later run either fetches exactly that sha or --
# if a clone is already sitting there at a different commit -- refuses and says
# so rather than quietly benchmarking the wrong tree. Deleting bench/krausest
# and re-running reproduces the pinned tree from scratch.
#
# WHY THE REFERENCE BUILDS ARE PART OF SETUP
# ------------------------------------------
# vanillajs (keyed and non-keyed), solid and leptos are the comparison, and all
# four are slow-ish npm installs that have nothing to do with our code. Doing
# them here means a run.sh invocation is only ever building OUR two entries, so
# the expensive-and-boring part is not repeated on every measurement attempt.
#
# leptos is the odd one: it is a Rust framework, and if its build-prod actually
# shelled out to cargo/trunk we would need a wasm toolchain we do not have. It
# does not -- the entry commits its built bundle and build-prod is a no-op copy
# -- but that is an upstream fact that could change, so it is asserted rather
# than assumed, and the fallback is to use the committed bundle and warn.
